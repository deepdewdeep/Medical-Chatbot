After digesting a \\nMerck Manual\\n topic, readers will be well prepared to understand and evaluate the\\nwealth of more detailed information available elsewhere.\\nAs it has for over 110 years, \\nThe Merck Manual\\n focuses on discussions of specific disorders, organized\\nby organ system or medical specialty. In its structured introductions to medical disorders, \\nThe Manual\\nprovides health care practitioners and students with straightforward, practical explanations of \"what to do\"\\nto diagnose and treat those conditions. We discuss when to suspect a disease, the proper sequence of\\nevaluation, and the first-line options for treatment along with selected alternatives. In addition, we provide\\nenough background information on etiology and pathophysiology to ensure comprehension of the\\nmanagement recommendations.\\nThe Manual\\n continues to enhance its accessibility. In addition to having introductory \"nut-shells\" at the\\nbeginning of each disease discussion, we have included bulleted lists in the text whenever possible,\\nincluding at the beginning of diagnosis and treatment discussions.\\nIn the interest of brevity, \\nThe Merck Manual\\n has never cited references to the medical literature.\\nNonetheless, readers can be assured that our hundreds of contributors and dozens of peer reviewers are\\npresenting the best current recommendations, soundly based on available evidence.\\nAlthough the printed \\nMerck Manual\\n has long since grown too big to be carried in a lab coat, it has\\nreturned to the pocket as content on many different handheld electronic devices. In addition, \\nThe Merck\\nManual\\n continues to be available to all readers free of charge at www.merckmanuals.com\\n. Although our\\nelectronic versions have a currency that a printed product cannot, the book still provides a better in-depth\\nreading experience along with a tactile satisfaction and ease of perusal not possessed by electronic\\ndevices. Undoubtedly this will change as technology advances, but whatever the platform, we will\\ncontinue to strive to keep \\nThe Merck Manual\\n as useful as ever.\\nWe thank the numerous contributors who have worked diligently with us to craft this edition, and we hope\\nyou will find it worthy of continued and frequent use.

Porter, MD\\nEditor-in-Chief\\nCommitted to Providing Medical Information: Merck and The Merck Manuals\\nIn 1899, the American drug manufacturer Merck & Co. first published a small book titled \\nMerck\\'s Manual\\nof the Materia Medica\\n. It was meant as an aid to physicians and pharmacists, reminding doctors that\\n\"Memory is treacherous.\" Compact in size, easy to use, and comprehensive, \\nThe Merck Manual\\n (as it\\nwas later known) became a favorite of those involved in medical care and others in need of a medical\\nreference. Even Albert Schweitzer carried a copy to Africa in 1913, and Admiral Byrd carried a copy to the\\nSouth Pole in 1929.\\nBy the 1980s, the book had become the world\\'s largest selling medical text and was translated into more\\nthan a dozen languages. While the name of the parent company has changed somewhat over the years,\\nthe book\\'s name has remained constant, known officially as \\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis and\\nTherapy\\n but usually referred to as \\nThe Merck Manual\\n and sometimes \"The Merck.\"\\nIn 1990, the editors of \\nThe Merck Manual\\n introduced \\nThe Merck Manual of Geriatrics\\n. This new book\\nquickly became the best-selling textbook of geriatric medicine, providing specific and comprehensive\\ninformation on the care of older people. The 3rd edition was published in five languages.\\nIn 1997, \\nThe Merck Manual of Medical Information-Home Edition\\n was published. In this revolutionary\\nbook, the editors translated the complex medical information in \\nThe Merck Manual\\n into plain language,\\nproducing a book meant for all those people interested in medical care who did not have a medical\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Front Matter\\n5'),\n",

Nutrition: General Considerations\\nIntroduction\\nNutrition is the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrients are chemicals in foods that are\\nused by the body for growth, maintenance, and energy. Nutrients that cannot be synthesized by the body\\nand thus must be derived from the diet are considered essential. They include vitamins, minerals, some\\namino acids, and some fatty acids. Nutrients that the body can synthesize from other compounds,\\nalthough they may also be derived from the diet, are considered nonessential. Macronutrients are\\nrequired by the body in relatively large amounts; micronutrients are needed in minute amounts.\\nLack of nutrients can result in deficiency syndromes (eg, kwashiorkor, pellagra) or other disorders (see p.\\n9\\n). Excess intake of macronutrients can lead to obesity (see p. \\n56\\n) and related disorders; excess intake of\\nmicro-nutrients can be toxic. Also, the balance of various types of nutrients, such as how much\\nusaturated vs saturated fat is consumed, can influence the development of disorders.\\nMacronutrients\\nMacronutrients constitute the bulk of the diet and supply energy and many essential nutrients.\\nCarbohydrates, proteins (including essential amino acids), fats (including essential fatty acids),\\nmacrominerals, and water are macronutrients. Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are interchangeable as\\nsources of energy; fats yield 9 kcal/g (37.8 kJ/g); proteins and carbohydrates yield 4 kcal/g (16.8 kJ/g).\\nCarbohydrates:\\n Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and other monosaccharides.\\nCarbohydrates increase blood glucose levels, supplying energy. Simple carbohydrates are composed of\\nsmall molecules, generally monosaccharides or disaccharides, which increase blood glucose levels\\nrapidly. Complex carbohydrates are composed of larger molecules, which are broken down into\\nmonosaccharides. Complex carbohydrates increase blood glucose levels more slowly but for a longer\\ntime. Glucose and sucrose are simple carbohydrates; starches and fiber are complex carbohydrates.\\nThe glycemic index measures how rapidly consumption of a carbohydrate increases plasma glucose\\nlevels. Values range from 1 (the slowest increase) to 100 (the fastest increase, equivalent to pure glucose\\n—see\\nTable 1-1\\n). However, the actual rate of increase also depends on what foods are consumed with the\\ncarbohydrate.\\nCarbohydrates with a high glycemic index may increase plasma glucose to high levels rapidly. It is\\nhypothesized that, as a result, insulin levels increase, inducing hypoglycemia and hunger, which tends to\\nlead to consumption of excess calories and weight gain. Carbohydrates with a low glycemic index\\nincrease plasma glucose levels slowly, resulting in lower postprandial insulin levels and less hunger,\\nwhich probably makes consumption of excess calories less likely. These effects are predicted to result in\\na more favorable lipid profile and a decreased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and complications of\\ndiabetes if present.\\nProteins:\\n Dietary proteins are broken down into peptides and amino acids. Proteins are required for\\ntissue maintenance, replacement, function, and growth. However, if the body is not getting enough\\ncalories from dietary sources or tissue stores (particularly of fat), protein may be used for energy.\\nAs the body uses dietary protein for tissue production, there is a net gain of protein (positive nitrogen\\nbalance). During catabolic\\n[\\nTable 1-1.\\n Glycemic Index of Some Foods]\\nstates (eg, starvation, infections, burns), more protein may be used (because body tissues are broken\\ndown) than is absorbed, resulting in a net loss of protein (negative nitrogen balance). Nitrogen balance is\\nbest determined by subtracting the amount of nitrogen excreted in urine and feces from the amount of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 1.

All people require 8 EAAs; infants also require histidine.\\nThe weight-adjusted requirement for dietary protein correlates with growth rate, which decreases from\\ninfancy until adulthood. The daily dietary protein requirement decreases from 2.2 g/kg in 3-mo-old infants\\nto 1.2 g/kg in 5-yr-old children and to 0.8 g/kg in adults. Protein requirements correspond to EAA\\nrequirements (see\\nTable 1-2\\n). Adults trying to increase muscle mass need very little extra protein beyond the requirements in\\nthe table.\\nThe amino acid composition of protein varies widely. Biological value (BV) reflects the similarity in amino\\nacid composition of protein to that of animal tissues; thus, BV indicates what percentage of a dietary\\nprotein provides EAAs for the body. A perfect match is egg protein, with a value of 100. Animal proteins in\\nmilk and meat have a high BV (~90); proteins in cereal and vegetables have a lower BV (~40), and some\\nderived proteins (eg, gelatin) have a BV of 0. The extent to which dietary proteins supply each other's\\nmissing amino acids (complementarity) determines the overall BV of the diet. The recommended daily\\nallowances (RDA) for protein assumes that the average mixed diet has a BV of 70.\\nFats:\\n Fats are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. Fats are required for tissue growth and hormone\\nproduction. Saturated fatty acids, common in animal fats, tend to be solid at room temperature. Except for\\npalm and coconut oils, fats derived from plants tend to be liquid at room temperature; these fats contain\\nhigh levels of monounsaturated fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).\\nPartial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (as occurs during food manufacturing) produces trans\\nfatty acids, which are solid or semisolid at room temperature. In the US, the main dietary source of trans\\nfatty acids is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, used in manufacturing certain foods (eg, cookies,\\ncrackers, chips) to prolong shelf-life. Trans fatty acids may elevate LDL cholesterol and lower HDL; they\\nmay also independently increase the risk of coronary artery disease.\\nEssential fatty acids (EFAs) are linoleic acid, an \\nω\\n-6 (n-6) fatty acid, and linolenic acid, an \\nω\\n-3 (n-3) fatty\\nacid. Other \\nω\\n-6 acids (eg, arachidonic acid) and other \\nω\\n-3 fatty acids (eg, eicosapentaenoic acid,\\ndocosahexaenoic acid) are required by the body but can be synthesized from EFAs.\\nEFAs (see also p. \\n19\\n) are needed for the formation of various eicosanoids (biologically active lipids),\\nincluding prostaglandins, thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and leukotrienes. Consumption of \\nω\\n-3 fatty acids\\nmay decrease the risk of coronary artery disease.\\n[\\nTable 1-2.\\n Essential Amino Acid Requirements in mg/kg Body Weight]\\nRequirements for EFAs vary by age. Adults require amounts of linoleic acid equal to at least 2% of total\\ncaloric needs and linolenic acid equal to at least 0.5%. Vegetable oils provide linoleic acid and linolenic\\nacid. Oils made from safflower, sunflower, corn, soya, primrose, pumpkin, and wheat germ provide large\\namounts of linoleic acid. Marine fish oils and oils made from flax-seeds, pumpkin, soy, and canola provide\\nlarge amounts of linolenic acid. Marine fish oils also provide some other \\nω\\n-3 fatty acids in large amounts.\\nMacrominerals:\\n Na, Cl, K, Ca, P, and Mg are required in relatively large amounts per day (see\\nTables 1-3\\n,\\n1-4\\n, and\\n5-2\\n).\\nWater:\\n Water is considered a macronutrient because it is required in amounts of 1 mL/kcal (0.24 mL/kJ)\\nof energy expended, or about 2500 mL/day. Needs vary with fever, physical activity, and changes in\\nclimate and humidity.\\n[\\nTable 1-3.\\n Macrominerals]\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 1.

Except for chromium, each of these is incorporated into enzymes or hormones required in\\nmetabolism. Except for deficiencies of iron and zinc, micromineral deficiencies are uncommon in\\ndeveloped countries (see \\nCh. 5\\n).\\nOther minerals (eg, aluminum, arsenic, boron, cobalt, fluoride, nickel, silicon, vanadium) have not been\\nproved essential for people. Fluoride, although not essential, helps prevent tooth decay by forming a\\ncompound with Ca (CaF\\n2\\n), which stabilizes the mineral matrix in teeth.\\nAll trace minerals are toxic at high levels, and some (arsenic, nickel, and chromium) may cause cancer.\\nOther Dietary Substances\\nThe daily human diet typically contains as many as 100,000 chemicals (eg, coffee contains 1000). Of\\nthese, only 300 are nutrients, only some of which are essential. However, many nonnutrients in foods are\\nuseful. For example, food additives (eg, preservatives, emulsifiers, antioxidants, stabilizers) improve the\\nproduction and stability of foods. Trace components (eg, spices, flavors, odors, colors, phytochemicals,\\nmany other natural products) improve appearance and taste.\\nFiber:\\n Fiber occurs in various forms (eg, cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, gums). It \\nincreases GI motility,\\nprevents constipation, and helps control diverticular disease. Fiber is thought to accelerate the elimination\\nof cancer-causing substances produced by bacteria in the large intestine. Epidemiologic evidence\\nsuggests an association between colon cancer and low fiber intake and a beneficial effect of fiber in\\npatients with functional bowel disorders, Crohn's disease, obesity, and hemorrhoids. Soluble fiber\\n(present in fruits, vegetables, oats, barley, and legumes) reduces the postprandial increase in blood\\nglucose and insulin and can reduce cholesterol levels.\\nThe typical Western diet is low in fiber (about 12 g/day) because of a high intake of highly refined wheat\\nflour and a low intake of fruits and vegetables. Increasing fiber intake to about 30 g/day by consuming\\nmore vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber cereals and grains is generally recommended. However, very high\\nfiber intake may reduce absorption of certain minerals.\\nNutritional Requirements\\nGood nutrition aims to achieve and maintain a desirable body composition and high potential for physical\\nand mental work. Balancing energy intake with energy expenditure is necessary for a desirable body\\nweight. Energy expenditure depends on age, sex, weight (see \\nTable 1-4\\n), and metabolic and physical\\nactivity. If energy intake exceeds expenditure, weight is gained. Taking in about 100 calories/day more\\nthan needed results in a weight gain of about 4 to 5 kg in a year. If energy intake is less than expenditure,\\nweight is lost.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 1. Nutrition: General Considerations\\n55\"),\n",

Every 5 yr, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences/National\\nResearch Council and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issues the dietary reference intakes\\n(DRIs) for protein, energy, and some vitamins and minerals (see \\nTables 1-4\\n,\\n4-1\\n, and \\n5-2\\n). For vitamins and minerals about which less is known, safe and adequate daily dietary\\nintakes are estimated.\\nPregnant women (see p. \\n2608\\n) and infants (see p. \\n2703\\n) have special nutritional needs.\\nThe USDA publishes the Food Guide Pyramid, which specifies the number of recommended daily\\nservings of various food groups. The recommendations are individualized based on age, sex, and\\nphysical activity (see\\nTable 1-5\\n). Generally, the recommended intake decreases with aging because physical activity tends to\\ndecrease, resulting in less energy expended. The new Food Guide Pyramid emphasizes the following:\\n• Increasing consumption of whole grains\\n• Increasing consumption of vegetables and fruits\\n• Substituting fat-free or low-fat milk products (or equivalents) for whole-fat milk products\\n• Reducing consumption of saturated fats and trans fatty acids\\n• Exercising regularly\\nAdequate fluid intake is also important.\\nFats should constitute ≤ 30% of total calories, and saturated and trans fatty acids should constitute <\\n10%. Excess intake of saturated fats contributes to atherosclerosis. Substituting polyunsaturated fatty\\nacids for saturated fats can decrease the risk of atherosclerosis. Routine use of nutritional supplements is\\nnot necessary or beneficial; some supplements can be harmful. For example, excess vitamin A can lead to\\nhypervitaminosis A, with headaches, osteoporosis, and rash.\\nNutrition in Clinical Medicine\\nNutritional deficiencies can often worsen health outcomes (whether a disorder is present or not), and\\nsome disorders (eg, malabsorption) can cause nutritional deficiencies. Also, many patients (eg, elderly\\npatients during acute hospitalization) have unsuspected nutritional deficiencies that require treatment.\\nMany medical centers have multi-disciplinary nutrition support teams of physicians, nurses, dietitians, and\\npharmacists to help the clinician prevent, diagnose, and treat occult nutritional deficiencies.\\nOvernutrition may contribute to chronic disorders, such as cancer, hypertension, obesity, diabetes\\nmellitus, and coronary artery disease. Dietary restrictions are necessary in many hereditary metabolic\\ndisorders (eg, galactosemia, phenylketonuria).\\nEvaluation of Nutritional Status\\nIndications for nutritional evaluation include undesirable body weight or body composition, suspicion of\\nspecific deficiencies or toxicities\\n[\\nTable 1-5.\\n Recommended Dietary Intake for 40-yr-Olds with Moderate Physical Activity*]\\nof essential nutrients, and, in infants and children, insufficient growth or development.

A dietitian can obtain a more detailed dietary history. It usually includes a list of foods\\neaten within the previous 24 h and a food questionnaire. A food diary may be used to record all foods\\neaten. The weighed ad libitum diet, in which the patient weighs and writes down all foods consumed, is\\nthe most accurate record.\\nA complete physical examination, including measurement of height and weight and distribution of body\\nfat, should be done.

Eating grapefruit can inhibit cytochrome P-450 34A, slowing metabolism of\\nsome drugs (eg, amiodarone, carbamazepine, cyclosporine, certain Ca channel blockers). Diets that alter\\nthe bacterial flora may markedly affect the overall metabolism of certain drugs. Some foods affect the\\nbody's response to drugs. For example, tyramine, a component of cheese and a potent vasoconstrictor,\\ncan cause hypertensive crisis in some patients who take monoamine oxidase inhibitors and eat cheese.\\nNutritional deficiencies can affect drug absorption and metabolism. Severe energy and protein\\ndeficiencies reduce enzyme tissue concentrations and may impair the response to drugs by reducing\\nabsorption or protein binding and causing liver dysfunction. Changes in the GI tract can impair absorption\\nand affect the response to a drug. Deficiency of Ca, Mg, or zinc may impair drug metabolism. Vitamin C\\ndeficiency decreases activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, especially in the elderly.\\nMany drugs affect appetite, food absorption, and tissue metabolism (see\\nTable 1-6\\n). Some drugs (eg, metoclopramide) increase GI motility, decreasing food absorption. Other\\ndrugs (eg, opioids, anticholinergics) decrease GI motility. Some drugs are better tolerated if taken with\\nfood.\\nCertain drugs affect mineral metabolism. For example, diuretics, especially thiazides, and corticosteroids\\ncan deplete body K, increasing susceptibility to digoxin-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Repeated use of\\nlaxatives may deplete K. Cortisol, desoxycorticosterone, and aldosterone cause marked Na and water\\nretention, at least temporarily; retention is much less with prednisone, prednisolone, and some other\\ncorticosteroid analogs. Sulfonylureas and lithium can impair the uptake or release of iodine by the thyroid.\\nOral contraceptives can lower blood zinc levels and increase copper levels. Certain antibiotics (eg,\\ntetracyclines) reduce iron absorption, as can certain foods (eg, vegetables, tea, bran).\\nCertain drugs affect vitamin absorption or metabolism.

Undernutrition\\nIntroduction\\nUndernutrition is a form of malnutrition. (Malnutrition also includes overnutrition—see \\nCh. 6\\n).\\nUndernutrition can result from inadequate ingestion of nutrients, malabsorption, impaired\\nmetabolism, loss of nutrients due to diarrhea, or increased nutritional requirements (as occurs\\nin cancer or infection). Undernutrition progresses in stages; each stage usually takes\\nconsiderable time to develop. First, nutrient levels in blood and tissues change, followed by\\nintracellular changes in biochemical functions and structure. Ultimately, symptoms and signs\\nappear.\\nRisk Factors\\nUndernutrition is associated with many disorders and circumstances, including poverty and social\\ndeprivation. Risk is also greater at certain times (ie, during infancy, early childhood, adolescence,\\npregnancy, breastfeeding, and old age).\\nInfancy and childhood:\\n Infants and children are particularly susceptible to undernutrition because of\\ntheir high demand for energy and essential nutrients. Because vitamin K does not readily cross the\\nplacenta, neonates may be deficient, so all are given a single injection of vitamin K within 1 h of birth to\\nprevent hemorrhagic disease of the newborn, a life-threatening disorder (see pp. \\n46\\n and\\n2783\\n). Infants fed only breast milk, which is typically low in vitamin D, are given supplemental vitamin D;\\nthey can develop vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency if the mother is a vegan. Inadequately fed infants and children\\nare at risk of protein-energy undernutrition (PEU—previously called protein-energy malnutrition) and\\ndeficiencies of iron, folate (folic acid), vitamins A and C, copper, and zinc. During adolescence, nutritional\\nrequirements increase because the growth rate accelerates. Anorexia nervosa (see p. \\n1535\\n) may affect\\nadolescent girls in particular.\\nPregnancy and breastfeeding:\\n Requirements for nutrients increase during pregnancy and\\nbreastfeeding. Aberrations of diet, including pica (consumption of nonnutritive substances, such as clay\\nand charcoal), may occur during \\npregnancy. Anemia due to iron deficiency is common, as is anemia due\\nto folate deficiency, especially among women who have taken oral contraceptives. Vitamin D deficiency is\\ncommon during late pregnancy, predisposing the child to decreased bone mass.\\nOld age:\\n Aging—even when disease or dietary deficiency is absent—leads to sarcopenia (progressive\\nloss of lean body mass), starting after age 40 and eventually amounting to a muscle loss of about 10 kg\\n(22 lb) in men and 5 kg (11 lb) in women. Undernutrition contributes to sarcopenia, and sarcopenia\\naccounts for many of the complications of undernutrition (eg, decreased nitrogen balance, increased\\nsusceptibility to infections). Causes of sarcopenia include the following:\\n• Decreased physical activity\\n• Decreased food intake\\n• Increased levels of cytokines (particularly interleukin-6)\\n• Decreased levels of growth hormone and mechano growth factor (insulin-like growth factor-3)\\n• In men, decreasing androgen levels\\nAging decreases basal metabolic rate (due mainly to decreased fat-free mass), total body weight, height,\\nand skeletal mass; aging increases mean body fat (as a percentage of body weight) to about 30% (from\\n20%) in men and to 40% (from 27%) in women.\\nFrom age 20 to 80, food intake decreases, especially in men. Anorexia due to aging itself has many\\ncauses, including reduced adaptive relaxation of the stomach's fundus, increased release and activity of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 2.

Occasionally, anorexia\\nnervosa (sometimes called anorexia tardive in the elderly), paranoia, or mania interferes with eating.\\nDental problems limit the ability to chew and subsequently to digest foods. Swallowing difficulties (eg, due\\nto strokes, other neurologic disorders, esophageal candidiasis, or xerostomia) are common. Poverty or\\nfunctional impairment limits access to nutrients.\\nThe institutionalized elderly are at particular risk of PEU. They are often confused and may be unable to\\nexpress hunger or preferences for foods. They may be physically unable to feed themselves. Chewing or\\nswallowing may be very slow, making it tedious for another person to feed them enough food.\\nIn the elderly, particularly the institutionalized elderly, inadequate intake and often decreased absorption\\nor synthesis of vitamin D, increased demand for vitamin D, and inadequate exposure to sunshine\\ncontribute to osteomalacia (see p. \\n41\\n).\\nDisorders and medical procedures:\\n Diabetes, some chronic disorders that affect the GI tract, intestinal\\nresection, and certain other GI surgical procedures tend to impair absorption of fat-soluble vitamins,\\nvitamin B\\n12\\n, Ca, and iron. Gluten enteropathy, pancreatic insufficiency, or other disorders can result in\\nmalabsorption. Decreased absorption possibly contributes to iron deficiency and osteoporosis. Liver\\ndisorders impair storage of vitamins A and B\\n12\\n and interfere with metabolism of protein and energy\\nsources.

Average values for the mid upper arm muscle\\narea are 54 ± 11 cm\\n2\\n for men and 30 ± 7 cm\\n2\\n for women. A value < 75% of this standard (depending on\\nage) indicates depletion of lean body mass (see\\nTable 2-2\\n).

It commonly includes deficiencies of\\nmany micronutrients. PEU can be sudden and total (starvation) or gradual. Severity ranges from\\nsubclinical deficiencies to obvious wasting (with edema, hair loss, and skin atrophy) to\\nstarvation. Multiple organ systems are often impaired. Diagnosis usually involves laboratory\\ntesting, including serum albumin. Treatment consists of correcting fluid and electrolyte deficits\\nwith IV solutions, then gradually replenishing nutrients, orally if possible.\\nIn developed countries, PEU is common among the institutionalized elderly (although often not suspected)\\nand among patients with disorders that decrease appetite or impair nutrient digestion, absorption, or\\nmetabolism. In developing countries, PEU affects children who do not consume enough calories or\\nprotein.\\nClassification and Etiology\\nPEU is graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Grade is determined by calculating weight as a percentage\\nof expected weight for length or height using international standards (normal, 90 to 110%; mild PEU, 85 to\\n90%; moderate, 75 to 85%; severe, <75%).\\nPEU may be primary or secondary.

Kwashiorkor may also\\nresult from an acute illness, often gastroenteritis or another infection (probably secondary to cytokine\\nrelease), in a child who already has PEU. A diet that is more deficient in protein than energy may be more\\nlikely to cause kwashiorkor than marasmus. Less common than marasmus, kwashiorkor tends to be\\nconfined to specific parts of the world, such as rural Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific islands. In\\nthese areas, staple foods (eg, yams, cassavas, sweet potatoes, green bananas) are low in protein and\\nhigh in carbohydrates. In kwashiorkor, cell membranes leak, causing extravasation of intravascular fluid\\nand protein, resulting in peripheral edema.\\nStarvation is a complete lack of nutrients. It occasionally occurs when food is available (as in fasting or\\nanorexia nervosa) but usually occurs because food is unavailable (eg, during famine or wilderness\\nexposure).\\nSecondary PEU:\\n This type most commonly results from the following:\\n• Disorders that affect GI function: These disorders can interfere with digestion (eg, pancreatic\\ninsufficiency), absorption (eg, enteritis, enteropathy), or lymphatic transport of nutrients (eg,\\nretroperitoneal fibrosis, Milroy's disease).\\n• Wasting disorders: In wasting disorders (eg, AIDS, cancer) and renal failure, catabolism causes cytokine\\nexcess, resulting in undernutrition via anorexia and cachexia (wasting of muscle and fat). End-stage\\nheart failure can cause cardiac cachexia, a severe form of undernutrition; mortality rate is particularly\\nhigh. Factors contributing to cardiac cachexia may include passive hepatic congestion (causing\\nanorexia), edema of the intestinal tract (impairing absorption), and, in advanced disease, increased O\\n2\\nrequirement due to anaerobic metabolism. Wasting disorders can decrease appetite or impair\\nmetabolism of nutrients.\\n• Conditions that increase metabolic demands: These conditions include infections, hyperthyroidism,\\npheochromocytoma, other endocrine disorders, burns, trauma, surgery, and other critical illnesses.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe initial metabolic response is decreased metabolic rate. To supply energy, the body first breaks down\\nadipose tissue. However, later when these tissues are depleted, the body may use protein for energy,\\nresulting in a negative nitrogen balance. Visceral organs and muscle are broken down and decrease in\\nweight. Loss of organ weight is greatest in the liver and intestine, intermediate in the heart and kidneys,\\nand least in the nervous system.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms of moderate PEU can be constitutional or involve specific organ systems. Apathy and irritability\\nare common. The patient is weak, and work capacity decreases. Cognition and sometimes\\nconsciousness are impaired. Temporary lactose deficiency and achlorhydria develop. Diarrhea is common\\nand can be aggravated by deficiency of intestinal disaccharidases, especially lactase (see p. \\n157\\n).\\nGonadal tissues atrophy. PEU can cause amenorrhea in women and loss of libido in men and women.\\nWasting of fat and muscle is common in all forms of PEU. In adult volunteers who fasted for 30 to 40\\ndays, weight loss was marked (25% of initial weight). If starvation is more prolonged, weight loss may\\nreach 50% in adults and possibly more in children.\\nIn adults, cachexia is most obvious in areas where prominent fat depots normally exist. Muscles shrink\\nand bones protrude. The skin becomes thin, dry, inelastic, pale, and cold. The hair is dry and falls out\\neasily, becoming sparse. Wound healing is impaired.

In children and adolescents, child abuse and\\nanorexia nervosa should be considered.\\nPhysical examination findings can usually confirm the diagnosis. Laboratory tests are required if dietary\\nhistory does not clearly indicate inadequate caloric intake. Measurement of serum albumin, total\\nlymphocyte count, CD4+ T lymphocytes, transferrin, and response to skin antigens may help determine\\nthe severity of PEU (see \\nTable 2-3\\n) or confirm the diagnosis in borderline cases. Many other test results\\nmay be abnormal: eg, decreased levels of hormones, vitamins, lipids, cholesterol, prealbumin, insulin\\ngrowth factor-1, fibronectin, and retinol-binding protein. Urinary creatine and methylhistidine levels can be\\nused to gauge the degree of muscle wasting. Because protein catabolism slows, urinary urea level also\\ndecreases.

Mortality rates are lower in children with mild PEU\\nand those given intensive care. Death in the first days of treatment is usually due to electrolyte deficits,\\nsepsis, hypothermia, or heart failure. Impaired consciousness, jaundice, petechiae, hyponatremia, and\\npersistent diarrhea are ominous signs. Resolution of apathy, edema, and anorexia is a favorable sign.\\nRecovery is more rapid in kwashiorkor than in marasmus.\\nLong-term effects of PEU in children are not fully documented. Some children develop chronic\\nmalabsorption and pancreatic insufficiency. In very young children, mild intellectual disability may develop\\nand persist until at least school age. Permanent cognitive impairment may occur, depending on the\\nduration, severity, and age at onset of PEU.\\nAdults:\\n In adults, PEU can result in morbidity and mortality (eg, progressive weight loss increases\\nmortality rate for elderly patients in nursing homes). In elderly patients, PEU increases the risk of\\nmorbidity and mortality due to surgery, infections, or other disorders. Except when organ failure occurs,\\ntreatment is uniformly successful.\\nTreatment\\n• Usually, oral feeding\\n• Possibly avoidance of lactose (eg, if persistent diarrhea suggests lactose intolerance)\\n• Supportive care (eg, environmental changes, assistance with feeding, orexigenic drugs)\\n• For children, feeding delayed 24 to 48 h\\nWorldwide, the most important preventive strategy is to reduce poverty and improve nutritional education\\nand public health measures.\\nMild or moderate PEU, including brief starvation, can be treated by providing a balanced diet, preferably\\norally. Liquid oral food supplements (usually lactose-free) can be used when solid food cannot be\\nadequately ingested. Diarrhea often complicates oral feeding because starvation makes the GI tract more\\nlikely to move bacteria into Peyer's patches, facilitating infectious diarrhea. If diarrhea persists\\n(suggesting lactose intolerance), yogurt-based rather than milk-based formulas are given because people\\nwith lactose intolerance can tolerate yogurt. Patients should also be given a multivitamin supplement.\\nSevere PEU or prolonged starvation requires treatment in a hospital with a controlled diet. The first\\npriority is to correct fluid and electrolyte abnormalities (see \\nCh. 97\\n) and treat infections. Next is to supply\\nmacronutrients orally or, if necessary (eg, when swallowing is difficult), through a feeding tube, a\\nnasogastric tube (usually), or a gastrostomy tube. Parenteral nutrition is indicated if malabsorption is\\nsevere (see p. \\n23\\n).\\nOther treatments may be needed to correct specific deficiencies, which may become evident as weight\\nincreases. To avoid deficiencies, patients should take micronutrients at about twice the recommended\\ndaily allowance (RDA) until recovery is complete.\\nChildren:\\n Underlying disorders should be treated. For children with diarrhea, feeding may be delayed 24\\nto 48 h to avoid making the diarrhea worse; during this interval, children require oral or IV rehydration.\\nFeedings are given often (6 to 12 times/day) but, to avoid overwhelming the limited intestinal absorptive\\ncapacity, are limited to small amounts (< 100 mL).

Nutritional Support\\nIntroduction\\nMany undernourished patients need nutritional support, which aims to increase lean body mass. Oral\\nfeeding can be difficult for some patients with anorexia or with eating or absorption problems. Behavioral\\nmeasures that sometimes enhance oral intake include the following:\\n• Encouraging patients to eat\\n• Heating or seasoning foods\\n• Providing favorite or strongly flavored foods\\n• Encouraging patients to eat small portions\\n• Scheduling around meals\\n• Assisting patients with feeding\\nIf behavioral measures are ineffective, nutritional support—oral, enteral tube, or parenteral nutrition—is\\nindicated, except sometimes for dying or severely demented patients (see p. \\n25\\n).\\nPredicting Nutritional Requirements\\nNutritional requirements are predicted so that interventions can be planned. Requirements can be\\nestimated by formulas or measured by indirect calorimetry. Indirect calorimetry requires use of a metabolic\\ncart (a closed rebreathing system that determines energy expenditure based on total CO\\n2\\n production),\\nwhich requires special expertise and is not always available. Thus, total energy expenditure (TEE) and\\nprotein requirements usually are estimated.\\nEnergy expenditure:\\n TEE varies based on the patient's weight, activity level, and degree of metabolic\\nstress (metabolic demands); TEE ranges from 25 kcal/kg/day for people who are sedentary and not under\\nstress to about 40 kcal/kg/day for people who are critically ill. TEE equals the sum of\\n• Resting metabolic rate (RMR, or resting energy expenditure rate), which is normally about 70% of TEE\\n• Energy dissipated by metabolism of food (10% of TEE)\\n• Energy expended during physical activity (20% of TEE)\\nUndernutrition can decrease RMR up to 20%. Conditions that increase metabolic stress (eg, critical\\nillness, infection, inflammation, trauma, surgery) can increase RMR but rarely by > 50%.\\nThe Mifflin-St. Jeor equation estimates RMR more precisely and with fewer errors than the commonly\\nused Harris-Benedict equation, usually providing results that are within 20% of those measured by\\nindirect calorimetry. The Mifflin-St. Jeor equation estimates RMR as follows:\\nMen\\n: kcal / day = 66 + (13.7 × wt[kg]) + (5 × height[cm]) - (6.8 × age)\\nWomen\\n: kcal / day = 665 + (9.6 × wt[kg]) + (1.8 × height[cm]) - (4.7 × age)\\nTEE can be estimated by adding about 10% (for sedentary people) to about 40% (for people who are\\ncritically ill) to RMR.\\nProtein requirements:\\n For healthy people, protein requirements are estimated at 0.8 g/kg/day.\\nHowever, for patients with metabolic stress or kidney failure and for elderly patients, requirements may be\\nhigher (see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 3.

Clinicians commonly use indicators of lean body mass\\nsuch as the following:\\n• Body mass index (BMI)\\n• Body composition analysis\\n• Body fat distribution (see pp.\\n11\\n and \\n58\\n)\\nNitrogen balance, response to skin antigens, muscle strength measurement, and indirect calorimetry can\\nalso be used.\\n[\\nTable 3-1.\\n Estimated Adult Daily Protein Requirement]\\nNitrogen balance,\\n which reflects the balance between protein needs and supplies, is the difference\\nbetween amount of nitrogen ingested and amount lost. A positive balance (ie, more ingested than lost)\\nimplies adequate intake. Precise measurement is impractical, but estimates help assess response to\\nnutritional support. Nitrogen intake is estimated from protein intake: nitrogen (g) equals protein (g)/6.25.\\nEstimated nitrogen losses consist of urinary nitrogen losses (estimated by measuring urea nitrogen\\ncontent of an accurately obtained 24-h urine collection) plus stool losses (estimated at 1 g/day if stool is\\nproduced; negligible if stool is not produced) plus insensible and other unmeasured losses (estimated at\\n3 g).\\nResponse to skin antigens\\n, a measure of delayed hypersensitivity, often increases to normal as\\nundernourished patients respond to nutritional support. However, other factors can affect response to\\nskin antigens.\\nMuscle strength\\n indirectly reflects increases in lean body mass. It can be measured quantitatively, by\\nhand-grip dynamometry, or electrophysiologically (typically by stimulating the ulnar nerve with an\\nelectrode).\\nLevels of acute-phase reactant\\n serum proteins (particularly short-lived proteins such as prealbumin\\n[transthyretin], retinol-binding protein, and transferrin) sometimes correlate with improved nutritional\\nstatus, but these levels correlate better with inflammatory conditions.\\nEnteral Tube Nutrition\\nEnteral tube nutrition is indicated for patients who have a functioning GI tract but cannot ingest enough\\nnutrients orally because they are unable or unwilling to take oral feedings.

The TPN line should\\nnot be used for any other purpose. External tubing should be changed every 24 h with the first bag of the\\nday. In-line filters have not been shown to decrease complications. Dressings should be kept sterile and\\nare usually changed every 48 h using strict sterile techniques. If TPN is given outside the hospital,\\npatients must be taught to recognize symptoms of infection, and qualified home nursing must be\\narranged.\\nThe solution is started slowly at 50% of the calculated requirements, using 5% dextrose to make up the\\nbalance of fluid requirements. Energy and nitrogen should be given simultaneously. The amount of\\nregular insulin given (added directly to the TPN solution) depends on the plasma glucose level; if the\\nlevel is normal and the final solution contains 25% dextrose, the usual starting dose is 5 to 10 units of\\nregular insulin/L of TPN fluid.\\nMonitoring:\\n Progress should be followed on a flowchart. An interdisciplinary nutrition team, if available,\\nshould monitor patients. Weight, CBC, electrolytes, and BUN should be monitored often (eg, daily for\\ninpatients). Plasma glucose should be monitored every 6 h until patients and glucose levels become\\nstable. Fluid intake and output should be monitored continuously. When patients become stable, blood\\ntests can be done much less often.\\nLiver function tests should be done. Plasma proteins (eg, serum albumin, possibly transthyretin or retinol-\\nbinding protein), PT, plasma and urine osmolality, and Ca, Mg, and phosphate should be measured\\ntwice/wk. Changes in transthyretin and retinol-binding protein reflect overall clinical status rather than\\nnutritional status alone. If possible, blood tests should not be done during glucose infusion. Full nutritional\\nassessment (including BMI calculation and anthropometric measurements—see pp. \\n11\\n and \\n58\\n) should be\\nrepeated at 2-wk intervals.\\nComplications:\\n About 5 to 10% of patients have complications related to central venous access.\\n[\\nTable 3-3.\\n Basic Adult Daily Requirements for Total Parenteral Nutrition]\\nCatheter-related sepsis occurs in about ≥ 50% of patients. Glucose abnormalities (hyperglycemia or\\nhypoglycemia) or liver dysfunction occurs in > 90% of patients.\\nGlucose abnormalities\\n are common. Hyperglycemia can be avoided by monitoring plasma glucose\\noften, adjusting the insulin dose in the TPN solution and giving subcutaneous insulin as needed.\\nHypoglycemia can be precipitated by suddenly stopping constant concentrated dextrose infusions.\\nTreatment depends on the degree of hypoglycemia. Short-term hypoglycemia may be reversed with 50%\\ndextrose IV; more prolonged hypoglycemia may require infusion of 5 or 10% dextrose for 24 h before\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 3.

Vitamin Deficiency, Dependency, and Toxicity\\nIntroduction\\nVitamins may be fat soluble (vitamins A, D, E, and K) or water soluble (B vitamins and vitamin C). The B\\nvitamins include biotin, folate, niacin, pantothenic acid, riboflavin (B\\n2\\n), thiamin (B\\n1\\n), B\\n6\\n (eg, pyridoxine),\\nand B\\n12\\n (cobalamins). For dietary requirements, sources, functions, effects of deficiencies and toxicities,\\nblood levels, and usual therapeutic dosages for vitamins, see\\nTables 4-1\\n and\\n4-2\\n.\\nDietary requirements for vitamins (and other nutrients) are expressed as daily recommended intake (DRI).\\nThere are 3 types of DRI:\\n• \\nRecommended daily allowance (RDA):\\n RDAs are set to meet the needs of 97 to 98% of healthy\\npeople.\\n• \\nAdequate intake (AI):\\n When data to calculate an RDA are insufficient, AIs are based on observed or\\nexperimentally determined estimates of nutrient intake by healthy people.\\n• \\nTolerable upper intake level (UL):\\n ULs are the largest amount of a nutrient that most adults can\\ningest daily without risk of adverse health effects.\\nIn developed countries, vitamin deficiencies result mainly from poverty, food faddism, drugs (see p. \\n7\\n and\\nTable 4-3\\n), alcoholism, or prolonged and inadequately supplemented parenteral feeding. Mild vitamin\\ndeficiency is common among frail and institutionalized elderly people who have protein-energy\\nundernutrition. In developing countries, deficiencies can result from lack of access to nutrients.\\nDeficiencies of water-soluble vitamins (except vitamin B\\n12\\n) may develop after weeks to months of\\nundernutrition. Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and of vitamin B\\n12\\n take > 1 yr to develop because the\\nbody stores them in relatively large amounts. Intake of vitamins sufficient to prevent classic vitamin\\ndeficiencies (like scurvy or beriberi) may not be adequate for optimum health. This area remains one of\\ncontroversy and active research.\\nVitamin dependency results from a genetic defect involving metabolism of a vitamin. In some cases,\\nvitamin doses as high as 1000 times the DRI improve function of the altered metabolic pathway. Vitamin\\ntoxicity (hypervitaminosis) usually results from taking megadoses of vitamin A, D, C, B\\n6\\n, or niacin.\\nBecause many people eat irregularly, foods alone may provide suboptimal amounts of some vitamins. In\\nthese cases, the risk of certain cancers or other disorders may be increased. Because of this risk, routine\\ndaily multivitamin supplements are sometimes recommended.\\nBiotin and Pantothenic Acid\\nBiotin acts as a coenzyme for carboxylation reactions essential to fat and carbohydrate metabolism.\\nAdequate intake for adults is 30 \\nμ\\ng/day. Pantothenic acid is widely distributed in foods; it is an essential\\ncomponent of coenzyme A. Adults probably require about 5 mg/day. A beneficial role for pantothenic acid\\nsupplementation in lipid metabolism, RA, or athletic performance remains unproved. Isolated deficiency of\\nbiotin or pantothenic acid virtually never occurs.\\nFolate\\nFolate (folic acid) is now added to enriched grain foods in the US. Folate is also plentiful in various plant\\nfoods and meats, but its bioavailability is greater when it is in supplements\\n[\\nTable 4-1.\\n Recommended Daily Intakes for Vitamins]\\nor enriched foods than when it occurs naturally in food.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 4.

Bound niacin, found in\\nmaize, is not assimilated in the GI tract unless it has been previously treated with alkali, as when tortillas\\nare prepared. Corn protein is also deficient in tryptophan. The high incidence of pellagra in India among\\npeople who eat millet with a high leucine content has led to the hypothesis that amino acid imbalance may\\ncontribute to deficiency. Deficiencies of protein and many B vitamins commonly accompany primary niacin\\ndeficiency.\\nSecondary deficiency may be due to diarrhea, cirrhosis, or alcoholism. Pellagra also may occur in\\ncarcinoid syndrome (tryptophan is diverted to form 5-hydroxytryptophan and serotonin) and in Hartnup\\ndisease (absorption of tryptophan by the intestine and kidneys is defective).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPellagra is characterized by skin, mucous membrane, CNS, and GI symptoms. Advanced pellagra can\\ncause a symmetric photosensitive rash, stomatitis, glossitis, diarrhea, and mental aberrations. Symptoms\\nmay appear alone or in combination.\\nSkin symptoms\\n include several types of lesions, which are usually bilaterally symmetric.

Nicotinamide is usually used to treat deficiency, because\\nnicotinamide, unlike nicotinic acid (the most common form of niacin), does not cause flushing, itching,\\nburning, or tingling sensations. Nicotinamide is given in doses ranging from 40 to 250 mg/day po in\\ndivided doses 3 to 4 times a day.\\nNiacin Toxicity\\nNiacin (nicotinic acid) in large amounts is sometimes used to lower low-density lipoprotein\\n(LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL)\\ncholesterol levels. Symptoms may include flushing and, rarely, hepatotoxicity.\\nImmediate- and sustained-release preparations of niacin (but not nicotinamide) may improve lipid levels.\\nFlushing, which is prostaglandin-mediated, is more common with immediate-release preparations. It may\\nbe more intense after alcohol ingestion, aerobic activity, sun exposure, and consumption of spicy foods.\\nFlushing is minimized if niacin is taken after meals or if aspirin (325 mg) is taken 30 to 45 min before\\nniacin. The chance of severe flushing can be reduced by starting immediate-release niacin at a low dose\\n(eg, 50 mg tid) and increasing it very slowly. At intermediate doses (1000 mg/day), triglyceride levels\\ndecrease 15 to 20%, and HDL cholesterol levels increase 15 to 30%. Reductions in LDL cholesterol are\\nmodest (< 10%). Higher doses of niacin (3000 mg/day) reduce LDL cholesterol 15 to 20% but may cause\\njaundice, abdominal discomfort, blurred vision, worsening of hyperglycemia, and precipitation of\\npreexisting gout.

Korsakoff's psychosis consists of mental\\nconfusion, dysphonia, and confabulation with impaired memory of recent events. It probably results from\\nchronic deficiency and may develop after repeated episodes of Wernicke's encephalopathy.\\nCardiovascular (wet) beriberi\\n is myocardial disease due to thiamin deficiency. The first effects are\\nvasodilation, tachycardia, a wide pulse pressure, sweating, warm skin, and lactic acidosis. Later, heart\\nfailure develops, causing orthopnea and pulmonary and peripheral edema. Vasodilation can continue,\\nsometimes resulting in shock.\\nInfantile beriberi\\n occurs in infants (usually by age 3 to 4 wk) who are breastfed by thiamin-deficient\\nmothers. Heart failure (which may occur suddenly), aphonia, and absent deep tendon reflexes are\\ncharacteristic.\\nBecause thiamin is necessary for glucose metabolism, glucose infusions may precipitate or worsen\\nsymptoms of deficiency in thiamin-deficient people.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Favorable response to thiamin\\nDiagnosis is usually based on a favorable response to treatment with thiamin in a patient with symptoms\\nor signs of deficiency. Similar bilateral lower-extremity polyneuropathies due to other disorders (eg,\\ndiabetes, alcoholism, vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency, heavy metal poisoning) do not respond to thiamin. Single-\\nnerve neuritides (mononeuropathies—eg, sciatica) and multiple mononeuropathies (mononeuritis\\nmultiplex) are unlikely to result from thiamin deficiency.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 4.

Dark adaptation can be impaired in other disorders (eg, zinc\\ndeficiency, retinitis pigmentosa, severe refractive errors, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy). If dark\\nadaptation is impaired, rod scotometry and electroretinography are done to determine whether vitamin A\\ndeficiency is the cause.\\nSerum levels of retinol are measured. Normal range is 28 to 86 \\nμ\\ng/dL (1 to 3 \\nμ\\nmol/L). However, levels\\ndecrease only after the deficiency is advanced because the liver contains large stores of vitamin A. Also,\\ndecreased levels may result from acute infection, which causes retinol-binding protein and transthyretin\\n(also called prealbumin) levels to decrease transiently. A therapeutic trial of vitamin A may help confirm\\nthe diagnosis.\\nPrevention\\nThe diet should include dark green leafy vegetables, deep- or bright-colored fruits (eg, papayas,\\noranges), carrots, and yellow vegetables (eg, squash, pumpkin). Vitamin A-fortified milk and cereals, liver,\\negg yolks, and fish liver oils are helpful. Carotenoids are absorbed better when consumed with some\\ndietary fat.

Both\\ntypes usually cause headache and increased intracranial pressure. Acute toxicity also causes\\nnausea and vomiting. Chronic toxicity also causes changes in skin, hair, and nails; abnormal\\nliver test results; and, in a fetus, birth defects. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Unless birth defects\\nare present, adjusting the dose almost always leads to complete recovery.\\nAcute vitamin A toxicity in children may result from taking large doses (> 100,000 RAE [> 300,000 IU]),\\nusually accidentally. In adults, acute toxicity has occurred when arctic explorers ingested polar bear or\\nseal livers, which contain several million units of vitamin A.\\nChronic toxicity in older children and adults usually develops after doses of > 30,000 RAE (> 100,000\\nIU)/day have been taken for months. Megavitamin therapy is a possible cause, as are massive daily\\ndoses (50,000 to 120,000 RAE [150,000 to 350,000 IU]) of vitamin A \\nor its metabolites, which are\\nsometimes given for nodular acne or other skin disorders. Adults who consume > 1500 RAE (> 4500\\nIU)/day of vitamin A may develop osteoporosis. Infants who are given excessive doses (6,000 to 20,000\\nRAE [18,000 to 60,000 IU]/day) of water-miscible vitamin A may develop toxicity within a few weeks. Birth\\ndefects occur in children of women receiving isotretinoin (which is related to vitamin A) for acne treatment\\nduring pregnancy.\\nAlthough carotene is converted to vitamin A in the body, excessive ingestion of carotene causes\\ncarotenemia, not vitamin A toxicity. Carotenemia is usually asymptomatic but may lead to carotenodermia,\\nin which the skin becomes yellow. When taken as a supplement, \\nβ\\n-carotene has been associated with\\nincreased cancer risk; risk does not seem to increase when carotenoids are consumed in fruits and\\nvegetables.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAlthough symptoms may vary, headache and rash usually develop during acute or chronic toxicity. Acute\\ntoxicity causes increased intracranial pressure. Drowsiness, irritability, abdominal pain, nausea, and\\nvomiting are common. Sometimes the skin subsequently peels.\\nEarly symptoms of chronic toxicity are sparsely distributed, coarse hair; alopecia of the eyebrows; dry,\\nrough skin; dry eyes; and cracked lips. Later, severe headache, pseudotumor cerebri, and generalized\\nweakness develop. Cortical hyperostosis of bone and arthralgia may occur, especially in children.\\nFractures may occur easily, especially in the elderly. In children, toxicity can cause pruritus, anorexia, and\\nfailure to thrive.

It is important to remember that severe\\nneurologic disease may occur without anemia or macrocytosis.\\nCBC detects megaloblastic anemia. Tissue deficiency and macrocytic indexes may precede the\\ndevelopment of anemia. A vitamin B\\n12\\n level < 200 pg/mL (< 145 pmol/L) indicates vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency.\\nThe folate level is measured because vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency must be differentiated from folate deficiency\\nas a cause of megaloblastic anemia; folate supplementation can mask vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency and may\\nalleviate megaloblastic anemia but allow the neurologic deficits to progress or even accelerate.\\nWhen clinical judgment suggests vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency but the vitamin B\\n12\\n level is low-normal (200 to\\n350 pg/mL [145 to 260 pmol/L]) or hematologic indexes are normal, other tests can be done. Measuring\\nserum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels may be useful. An elevated MMA level supports vitamin B\\n12\\ndeficiency but may be due to renal failure. MMA levels can also be used to monitor the response to\\ntreatment. MMA levels remain normal in folate deficiency; homocysteine levels may be elevated with\\neither vitamin B\\n12\\n or folate deficiency. Less commonly, holotranscobalamin II (transcobalamin II-B\\n12\\ncomplex) content is measured; when holotranscobalamin II is < 40 pg/mL (< 30 pmol/L), vitamin B\\n12\\n is\\ndeficient.\\nAfter deficiency is diagnosed, additional tests may be indicated for younger adults but usually not for the\\nelderly. Unless dietary vitamin B\\n12\\n is obviously inadequate, measurement of serum gastrin levels or\\nautoantibodies to intrinsic factor may be done; sensitivity and specificity of these tests may be poor.\\nSchilling test:\\n The Schilling test is useful only if diagnosing intrinsic factor deficiency is important, as in\\nclassic pernicious anemia. This test is not necessary for most elderly patients. The Schilling test\\nmeasures absorption of free radiolabeled vitamin B\\n12\\n. Radiolabeled vitamin B\\n12\\n is given orally, followed\\nin 1 to 6 h by 1000 \\nμ\\ng (1 mg) of parenteral vitamin B\\n12\\n, which reduces uptake of radiolabeled vitamin\\nB\\n12\\n by the liver. Absorbed radiolabeled vitamin B\\n12\\n is excreted in urine, which is collected for 24 h. The\\namount excreted is measured, and the percentage of total radiolabeled vitamin B\\n12\\n is determined. If\\nabsorption is normal, ≥ 9% of the dose given appears in the urine. Reduced urinary excretion (< 5% if\\nkidney function is normal) indicates inadequate vitamin B\\n12\\n absorption. Improved absorption with the\\nsubsequent addition of intrinsic factor to radiolabeled vitamin B\\n12\\n confirms the diagnosis of pernicious\\nanemia. The test is often difficult to do or interpret because of incomplete urine collection or renal\\ninsufficiency.

Treatment usually consists of oral vitamin D; Ca and phosphate are\\nsupplemented as needed. Prevention is often possible.

Hyperparathyroidism increases absorption, bone mobilization, and renal\\nconservation of Ca but increases excretion of phosphate. As a result, the serum level of Ca may be\\nnormal, but because of hypophosphatemia, bone mineralization is impaired.\\nEtiology\\nVitamin D deficiency may result from the following.\\nInadequate exposure or intake:\\n Inadequate direct sunlight exposure (or sunscreen use) and\\ninadequate intake usually occur simultaneously to result in clinical deficiency. Susceptible people include\\nthe elderly (who are often undernourished and are not exposed to enough sunlight), and certain\\ncommunities (eg, women and children who are confined to the home or who wear clothing that covers the\\nentire body and face). Inadequate vitamin D stores are common among the elderly, particularly those who\\nare house-bound, institutionalized, or hospitalized or who have had a hip fracture. Recommended direct\\nsunlight exposure is 5 to 15 min (suberythemal dose) to arms and legs, or face, arms and hands, at least\\n3 times a week.\\nReduced absorption:\\n Malabsorption can deprive the body of dietary vitamin D; only a small amount of\\n25(OH)D is recirculated enterohepatically.\\nAbnormal metabolism:\\n Vitamin D deficiency may result from defects in the production of 25(OH)D or\\n1,25(OH)\\n2\\nD.

Dietary fat enhances its absorption. Infant formulas\\ncontain supplemental vitamin K. Vitamin K\\n2\\n refers to a group of compounds (menaquinones) synthesized\\nby bacteria in the intestinal tract; the amount synthesized does not satisfy the vitamin K requirement.\\nVitamin K controls the formation of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X in the liver. Other\\ncoagulation factors dependent on vitamin K are protein C, protein S, and protein Z; proteins C and S are\\nanticoagulants. Metabolic pathways conserve vitamin K. Once vitamin K has participated in formation of\\ncoagulation factors, the reaction product, vitamin K epoxide, is enzymatically converted to the active form,\\nvitamin K hydroquinone.\\nThe actions of vitamin K-dependent proteins require Ca. The vitamin K-dependent proteins, osteocalcin\\nand matrix \\nγ\\n-carboxy-glutamyl (Gla) protein, may have important roles in bone and other tissues. Forms of\\nvitamin K are common therapy for osteoporosis in Japan and other countries.\\nVitamin K Deficiency\\nVitamin K deficiency results from extremely inadequate intake, fat malabsorption, or use of\\ncoumarin anticoagulants. Deficiency is particularly common among breastfed infants. It impairs\\nclotting. Diagnosis is suspected based on routine coagulation study findings and confirmed by\\nresponse to vitamin K. Treatment consists of vitamin K given orally or, when fat malabsorption\\nis the cause or risk of bleeding is high, parenterally.\\nVitamin K deficiency decreases levels of prothrombin and other vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors,\\ncausing defective coagulation and, potentially, bleeding.\\nEtiology\\nWorldwide, vitamin K deficiency causes infant morbidity and mortality. Vitamin K deficiency causes\\nhemorrhagic disease of the newborn, which usually occurs 1 to 7 days postpartum. In affected neonates,\\nbirth trauma can cause intracranial hemorrhage. Neonates are prone to vitamin K deficiency because of\\nthe following:\\n• The placenta transmits lipids and vitamin K relatively poorly.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 4.

Iodine deficiency develops\\nwhen iodide intake is < 20 \\nμ\\ng/day. In mild or moderate deficiency, the thyroid gland, influenced by thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone (TSH), hypertrophies to concentrate iodide in itself, resulting in colloid goiter.\\nUsually, patients remain euthyroid; however, severe iodine deficiency in adults may cause hypothyroidism\\n(endemic myxedema). It can decrease fertility and increase risk of stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and\\nprenatal and infant mortality. Severe maternal iodine deficiency retards fetal growth and brain\\ndevelopment, sometimes resulting in birth defects, and, in infants, causes cretinism, which may include\\nintellectual disability, deaf-mutism, difficulty walking, short stature, and sometimes hypothyroidism.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Assessment of thyroid structure and function\\nDiagnosis in adults and children is usually based on thyroid function, examination for goiter, and imaging\\ntests identifying abnormalities in thyroid function and structure (see p.\\n776\\n). All neonates should be screened by measuring the TSH level.\\nTreatment\\n• Iodide with or without levothyroxine\\nInfants with iodine deficiency are given L-thyroxine 3 \\nμ\\ng/kg po once/day for a week plus iodide 50 to 90\\nμ\\ng po once/day for several weeks to quickly restore a euthyroid state. Children are treated with iodide 90\\nto 120 \\nμ\\ng once/day. Adults are given iodide 150 \\nμ\\ng once/day. Iodine deficiency can also be treated by\\ngiving levothyroxine. Serum TSH levels are monitored in all patients until the levels are normal (ie, < 5\\nμ\\nIU/mL).\\nIodine Toxicity\\nChronic toxicity may develop when intake is > 1.1 mg/day. Most people who ingest excess amounts of\\niodine remain euthyroid. Some people who ingest excess amounts of iodine, particularly those who were\\npreviously deficient, develop hyperthyroidism (Jod-Basedow phenomenon). Paradoxically, excess uptake\\nof iodine by the thyroid may inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis (called Wolff-Chaikoff effect). Thus, iodine\\ntoxicity can eventually cause iodide goiter, hypothyroidism, or myxedema. Very large amounts of iodide\\nmay cause a brassy taste in the mouth, increased salivation, GI irritation, and acneiform skin lesions.\\nPatients exposed to frequent large amounts of radiographic contrast dyes or the drug amiodarone also\\nneed to have their thyroid function monitored.\\nDiagnosis is usually based on thyroid function and imaging test findings (see p. \\n776\\n), which are\\ncorrelated with clinical data. Iodine excretion may be more specific but is not usually measured. Treatment\\nconsists of correcting thyroid abnormalities and, if intake is excessive, dietary modification.\\nIron\\nIron (Fe) is a component of hemoglobin, myoglobin, and many enzymes in the body. \\nHeme iron, contained\\nmainly in animal products, is absorbed much better than nonheme iron (eg, in plants and grains), which\\naccounts for > 85% of iron in the average diet. However, absorption of nonheme iron is increased when it\\nis consumed with animal protein and vitamin C.\\nDeficiency:\\n Iron deficiency is one of the most common mineral deficiencies in the world. It may result\\nfrom the following:\\n• Inadequate iron intake, common in infants, adolescent girls, and pregnant women\\n• Malabsorption (eg, celiac sprue)\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 5.

Obesity and the Metabolic Syndrome\\nObesity\\nObesity is excess body fat; consequences depend not only on the absolute amount but also on\\nthe distribution of the fat. Complications include cardiovascular disorders, diabetes mellitus,\\nmany cancers, cholelithiasis, fatty liver and cirrhosis, osteoarthritis, reproductive disorders in\\nmen and women, psychologic disorders, and premature death. Diagnosis is based on body\\nmass index (BMI—calculated from height and weight) and waist circumference. BP, fasting\\nplasma glucose, and lipid levels should be measured. Treatment includes physical activity,\\ndietary and behavioral modification, and sometimes drugs or surgery.\\nPrevalence of obesity in the US is high and is increasing, particularly among children and adolescents\\n(see\\nTable 6-1\\n).\\nPrevalence is more than twice as high at age 55 as at age 20. Obesity is twice as common among women\\nin a lower socioeconomic group as among those in a higher group. Prevalence among black and white\\nmen does not differ significantly, but it is higher among black women than white women. More than 50%\\nof black women ≥ 40 yr are obese; > 80% are overweight.\\nIn the US, obesity and its complications cause as many as 300,000 premature deaths each year, making\\nit second only to cigarette smoking as a preventable cause of death.\\n[\\nTable 6-1.\\n Changes in Prevalence of Obesity According to Nhanes]\\nEtiology\\nAlmost all cases of obesity result from a combination of genetic predisposition and a chronic imbalance\\nbetween energy intake, energy utilization for basic metabolic processes, and energy expenditure from\\nphysical activity.\\nGenetic factors:\\n Heritability of BMI is about 66%. Genetic factors may affect the many signaling\\nmolecules and receptors used by parts of the hypothalamus and GI tract to regulate food intake (see\\nSidebar 6-1\\n). Rarely, obesity results from abnormal levels of peptides that regulate food intake (eg, leptin)\\nor abnormalities in their receptors (eg, melanocortin-4 receptor).\\nGenetic factors also regulate energy expenditure, including BMR, diet-induced thermogenesis, and\\nnonvoluntary activity-associated thermogenesis. Genetic factors may have a greater effect on the\\ndistribution of body fat, particularly abdominal fat (see \\nMetabolic Syndrome\\n on p. \\n64\\n), than on the amount\\nof body fat.\\nEnvironmental factors:\\n Weight is gained when caloric intake exceeds energy needs. Important\\ndeterminants of energy intake include portion sizes and the energy density of the food. High-fat foods,\\nprocessed foods, and diets high in refined carbohydrates, soft drinks, fruit juices, and alcohol promote\\nweight gain. Diets high in fresh fruit and vegetables, fiber, and complex carbohydrates, with water as the\\nmain fluid consumed, minimize weight gain. A sedentary lifestyle promotes weight gain.\\nRegulatory factors:\\n Prenatal maternal obesity, prenatal maternal smoking, intrauterine growth\\nrestriction, and insufficient sleep can disturb weight regulation. About 15% of women permanently gain ≥\\n20 lb with each pregnancy. Obesity that persists beyond early childhood makes weight loss in later life\\nmore difficult.\\nDrugs, including corticosteroids, lithium, traditional antidepressants (tricyclics, tetracyclics, and\\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]), benzodiazepines, and antipsychotic drugs, often cause weight\\ngain.\\nUncommonly, weight gain is caused by one of the following disorders:\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 6.

Development of safer laparoscopic approaches has made this\\nsurgery more popular.\\nIndications\\nTo qualify for bariatric surgery, patients should\\n• Have acceptable operative risk\\n• Be well-informed and motivated\\n• Have unsuccessfully tried all reasonable nonsurgical methods to lose weight and manage obesity-\\nassociated complications\\n• Have a BMI of > 40 kg/m\\n2\\n or a BMI > 35 kg/m\\n2\\n plus a serious complication (eg, diabetes, hypertension,\\nobstructive sleep apnea, high-risk lipid profile) that could be expected to be meaningfully reduced with a\\nweight loss of 5 to 10%\\nContraindications include uncontrolled major depression or psychosis, binge eating disorders, current\\ndrug or alcohol abuse, severe coagulopathy, and inability to comply with nutritional requirements,\\nincluding lifelong vitamin replacement (when indicated). Whether bariatric surgery is appropriate for\\npatients < 18 or > 65 yr is controversial.\\nProcedures\\n• Restrictive procedures (adjustable gastric banding, vertical banded gastroplasty)\\n• Malabsorptive procedures (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)\\nMost procedures can be done laparoscopically, but the approach depends on the type of procedure as\\nwell as patient weight. Morbidity and mortality tend to be lower with laparoscopic than with open surgery.\\nHowever, if patients weigh ≥ 180 kg, open surgery is more likely to be successful. In about 8% of cases\\noverall (fewer with experienced surgeons), surgery begun laparoscopically must be finished as open\\nsurgery.\\nProcedures can be restrictive, malabsorptive, or both.\\nRestrictive procedures:\\n Restrictive procedures limit the volume of the stomach available for ingested\\nfood. This limited volume helps restrict food intake, probably because of earlier satiety. The effects can\\nbe partially defeated by patients who consume more high-calorie liquid foods (eg, milk shakes, alcohol),\\nwhich pass through the restricted portion quicker.\\nPurely restrictive procedures include adjustable gastric banding and vertical banded gastroplasty.\\n[\\nFig. 6-1.\\n Adjustable gastric banding.]\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 6.

It is the 2nd most common bariatric\\nprocedure. A band is placed around the upper part of the stomach to divide the stomach into a small\\nupper pouch and a larger lower pouch. Saline can be injected into the band via a subcutaneous access\\nport. When saline is injected, the band expands, decreasing the size of the passageway through the\\nstomach. As a result, the upper pouch fills more quickly, sending a message to the brain that the stomach\\nis full; patients eat smaller meals and lose substantial amounts of weight over time. This procedure is\\nusually done laparoscopically. Saline can be removed to make the passageway larger. Even though\\nweight loss from gastric banding is slightly less than that from Roux-en-Y, morbidity and mortality are\\nmuch less and gastric banding can be reversed if necessary.\\nVertical banded gastroplasty\\n is no longer commonly done. A stapler is used to divide the stomach into\\na small upper pouch and a larger lower pouch. A nonexpandable plastic band is placed around the\\nopening where the upper pouch empties into the lower pouch.\\nMalabsorptive procedures:\\n Malabsorptive procedures, such as biliopancreatic diversion with a\\nduodenal switch and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, result in ingested food bypassing parts of the stomach\\nand small intestine, creating malabsorption, which leads to weight loss. These procedures are also\\nrestrictive.\\nRoux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery\\n accounts for about 80% of bariatric procedures in the US. It can\\noften be done laparoscopically. A small part of the proximal stomach is detached from the rest, creating a\\nstomach pouch of < 30 mL. Because stomach volume is smaller, satiety occurs earlier. Also, food\\nbypasses part of the stomach and small intestine, where it is normally absorbed, reducing the amount of\\nfood and calories absorbed. The pouch is connected to the proximal jejunum with a narrow opening,\\nproducing even more restriction. The segment of bypassed proximal small intestine (and thus the\\nbypassed stomach) is attached to the distal small intestine, enabling bile acids and pancreatic enzymes to\\nmix with GI contents; this mixing limits malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies. Because a\\ngastrojejunostomy is created, symptoms similar to the dumping-syndrome may occur after high glycemic\\nloads; symptoms (light-headedness, diaphoresis, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea) may inhibit the\\nconsumption of such foods by adverse conditioning.\\nBiliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch\\n accounts for < 5% of bariatric procedures done in\\nthe US. Part of the stomach is removed, causing restriction. The remaining part empties into the\\nduodenum. The duodenum is cut\\n[\\nFig. 6-2.\\n Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery.]\\nand attached to the ileum, bypassing much of the small intestine, including the sphincter of Oddi (where\\nbile acids and pancreatic enzymes enter); malabsorption results. This procedure is technically demanding\\nbut can sometimes be done laparoscopically. Malabsorption and nutritional deficiencies often develop.\\nPreoperative Evaluation\\nEvaluation should determine whether patients have a psychologic commitment to the lifestyle changes\\nand whether operative risks are acceptable. Sleep apnea testing is done.\\nExtensive preoperative evaluation is probably unnecessary. However, for certain morbidly obese patients\\n(BMI > 50 kg/m\\n2\\n), examining the cardiac, pulmonary, GI, metabolic, and psychologic systems helps\\nidentify patients with acceptable operative risk and helps select the appropriate procedure.

Psychologic stress factors must be specifically\\nsought. Because a psychiatric disorder does not preclude physiologic disease, the significance of vague,\\ndramatic, or bizarre complaints should not be minimized.\\nPatients report symptoms differently depending on their personality, the impact of the illness on their life,\\nand sociocultural influences. For example, nausea and vomiting may be minimized or reported indirectly\\nby a severely depressed patient but presented with dramatic urgency by a histrionic one.\\nPhysical examination:\\n Inspection of the abdomen with the patient supine may show a convex\\nappearance when bowel obstruction, ascites, or, rarely, a large mass is present. Auscultation to assess\\nbowel sounds and determine presence of bruits should follow. Percussion elicits hyperresonance\\n(tympany) in the presence of bowel obstruction and dullness with ascites and can determine the span of\\nthe liver. Palpation proceeds systematically, beginning gently to identify areas of tenderness and, if\\ntolerated, palpating deeper to locate masses or organomegaly.

Although the presence of red flag\\nfindings indicates a high likelihood of a physiologic cause, their absence does not rule it out.

Some findings suggestive of\\nspecific disorders are listed in \\nTable 7-1\\n.\\nFunctional CAP may result in pain similar to that of physiologic origin.

The physician should explain the laboratory findings and the nature of the problem and\\ndescribe how the pain is generated and how the patient perceives it (ie, that there is a constitutional\\ntendency to feel pain at times of stress). It is important to avoid perpetuating the negative psychosocial\\nconsequences of chronic pain (eg, prolonged absences from school or work, withdrawal from social\\nactivities) and to promote independence, social participation, and self-reliance. These strategies help the\\npatient control or tolerate the symptoms while participating fully in everyday activities.\\nDrugs such as aspirin, NSAIDs, H\\n2\\n receptor blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and tricyclic\\nantidepressants can be effective. Opioids should be avoided because they invariably lead to dependency.\\nCognitive methods (eg, relaxation training, biofeedback, hypnosis) may help by contributing to the\\npatient's sense of well-being and control.

Patients with red\\nflag findings should have testing appropriate to the symptoms (see \\nTable 7-5\\n).\\nThe assessment of chronic vomiting usually includes the previously listed laboratory tests plus upper GI\\nendoscopy, small-bowel x-rays, and tests to assess gastric emptying and antral-duodenal motility.\\nTreatment\\nSpecific conditions, including dehydration, are treated. Even without significant dehydration, IV fluid\\ntherapy (0.9% saline 1 L, or 20 mL/kg in children) often leads to reduction of symptoms. In adults, various\\nantiemetics are effective (see\\nTable 7-6\\n). Choice of agent varies somewhat with the cause and severity of symptoms. Typical use is the\\nfollowing:\\n• Motion sickness: Antihistamines, scopolamine patches, or both\\n• Mild to moderate symptoms: Prochlorperazine or metoclopramide\\n• Severe or refractory vomiting and vomiting caused by chemotherapy: 5-HT\\n3\\n antagonists\\nObviously, only parenteral agents should be used in actively vomiting patients.\\nFor psychogenic vomiting, reassurance indicates awareness of the patient\\'s discomfort and a desire to\\nwork toward relief of symptoms, regardless of cause. Comments such as \"nothing is wrong\" or \"the\\nproblem is emotional\" should be avoided. Brief symptomatic treatment with antiemetics can be tried. If\\nlong-term management is necessary, supportive, regular office visits may help resolve the underlying\\nproblem.\\nKey Points\\n• Many episodes have an obvious cause and benign examination and require only symptomatic treatment.\\n• Physicians should be alert for signs of an acute abdomen or significant intracranial disorder.\\n• Pregnancy should always be considered in females of childbearing age.\\nRumination\\nRumination is the (usually involuntary) regurgitation of small amounts of food from the stomach (most\\noften 15 to 30 min after eating) that are rechewed and, in most cases, again swallowed. Patients do not\\ncomplain of nausea or abdominal pain.\\n[\\nTable 7-6.\\n Some Drugs for Vomiting]\\nRumination is commonly observed in infants.

Approach to the Patient With Lower GI Complaints\\nIntroduction\\nLower GI complaints include constipation, diarrhea, gas and bloating, abdominal pain (see also p. \\n105\\n),\\nand rectal pain or bleeding (see \\nCh. 21\\n). As with upper GI complaints, lower GI complaints result from\\nphysiologic illness or represent a functional disorder (ie, no radiologic, biochemical, or pathologic\\nabnormalities found even after extensive evaluation). The reasons for functional symptoms are not clear.\\nEvidence suggests that patients with functional symptoms may have disturbances of motility, nociception,\\nor both; ie, they perceive as uncomfortable certain sensations (eg, luminal distention, peristalsis) that\\nother people do not find distressing.\\nNo bodily function is more variable and subject to external influences than defecation. Bowel habits vary\\nconsiderably from person to person and are affected by age, physiology, diet, and social and cultural\\ninfluences. Some people have unwarranted preoccupation with bowel habits. In Western society, normal\\nstool frequency ranges from 2 to 3/day to 2 to 3/wk. Changes in stool frequency, consistency, volume, or\\ncomposition (ie, presence of blood, mucus, pus, or excess fatty material) may indicate disease.\\nConstipation\\nConstipation is difficult or infrequent passage of stool, hardness of stool, or a feeling of incomplete\\nevacuation.\\nMany people incorrectly believe that daily defecation is necessary and complain of constipation if stools\\noccur less frequently. Others are concerned with the appearance (size, shape, color) or consistency of\\nstools. Sometimes the major complaint is dissatisfaction with the act of defecation or the sense of\\nincomplete evacuation after defecation. Constipation is blamed for many complaints (abdominal pain,\\nnausea, fatigue, anorexia) that are actually symptoms of an underlying problem (eg, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome [IBS], depression). Patients should not expect all symptoms to be relieved by a daily bowel\\nmovement, and measures to aid bowel habits should be used judiciously.\\nObsessive-compulsive patients often feel the need to rid the body daily of \"unclean\" wastes. Such\\npatients often spend excessive time on the toilet or become chronic users of cathartics.\\nEtiology\\nAcute constipation suggests an organic cause, whereas chronic constipation may be organic or functional\\n(see\\nTable 8-1\\n).\\nIn many patients, constipation is associated with sluggish movement of stool through the colon. This\\ndelay may be due to drugs, organic conditions, or a disorder of defecatory function (ie, pelvic floor\\ndysfunction). Patients with disordered defecation do not generate adequate rectal propulsive forces, do\\nnot relax the puborectalis and the external anal sphincter during defecation, or both. In IBS, patients have\\nsymptoms (eg, abdominal discomfort and altered bowel habits) but generally normal colonic transit and\\nanorectal functions. However, IBS-disordered defecation may coexist.\\nExcessive straining, perhaps secondary to pelvic floor dysfunctions, may contribute to anorectal\\npathology (eg, hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and rectal prolapse) and possibly even to syncope. Fecal\\nimpaction, which may cause or develop from constipation, is also common among elderly patients,\\nparticularly with prolonged bed rest or decreased physical activity. It is also common after barium has\\nbeen given by mouth or enema.\\nChanges with aging:\\n Constipation is common among elderly people because of low-fiber diets, lack of\\nexercise, coexisting medical conditions, and use of constipating drugs. Many elderly people have\\nmisconceptions about normal bowel habits and use laxatives regularly. Other changes that predispose the\\nelderly to constipation include increased rectal compliance and impaired rectal sensation (such that larger\\nrectal volumes are needed to elicit the desire to defecate).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 8.

The presence,\\namount, and duration of blood in the stool should also be elicited.\\nSymptoms of metabolic (eg, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus) and neurologic (eg, spinal cord injury)\\ndisorders and systemic symptoms (eg, weight loss) should also be sought. Prescription and\\nnonprescription drug use should be assessed, with specific questioning about anticholinergic and opioid\\ndrugs.\\nPhysical examination:\\n A general examination is done to look for signs of systemic disease, including\\nfever and cachexia. Abdominal masses should be sought by palpation. A rectal examination should be\\ndone not only for fissures, strictures, blood, or masses (including fecal impaction) but also to evaluate\\nanal resting tone (the puborectalis \"lift\" when patients squeeze the anal sphincter), perineal descent\\nduring simulated evacuation, and rectal sensation. Patients with defecatory disorders may have increased\\nanal resting tone (or anismus), reduced (ie, < 2 cm) or increased (ie, > 4 cm) perineal descent, and/or\\nparadoxical contraction of the puborectalis during simulated evacuation.\\nRed flags:\\n Certain findings raise suspicion of a more serious etiology of chronic constipation:\\n• Distended, tympanitic abdomen\\n• Vomiting\\n• Blood in stool\\n• Weight loss\\n• Severe constipation of recent onset/worsening in elderly patients\\nInterpretation of findings:\\n Certain symptoms (eg, a sense of anorectal blockage, prolonged or difficult\\ndefecation), particularly when associated with abnormal (ie, increased or reduced) perineal motion during\\nsimulated evacuation, suggest a defecatory disorder. A tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen, particularly\\nwhen there is nausea and vomiting, suggests mechanical obstruction.\\nPatients with IBS typically have abdominal pain with disordered bowel habits (see p. \\n162\\n). Chronic\\nconstipation with modest abdominal discomfort in a patient who has used laxatives for a long time\\nsuggests slow-transit constipation. Acute constipation coincident with the start of a constipating drug in\\npatients without red flag findings suggests the drug is the cause. New-onset constipation that persists for\\nweeks or occurs intermittently with increasing frequency or severity, in the absence of a known cause,\\nsuggests colonic tumor or other causes of partial obstruction. Excessive straining or prolonged or\\nunsatisfactory defecation, with or without anal digitation, suggests a defecatory disorder. Patients with\\nfecal impaction may have cramps and may pass watery mucus or fecal material around the impacted\\nmass, mimicking diarrhea (paradoxic diarrhea).\\nTesting:\\n Testing is guided by clinical presentation.\\nConstipation with a clear etiology (drugs, trauma, bed rest) may be treated symptomatically without further\\nstudy.

If the primary complaint is infrequent defecation, colonic\\ntransit times should be measured with radiopaque markers or scintigraphy. If the primary complaint is\\ndifficulty with defecation, anorectal manometry and rectal balloon expulsion should be assessed.\\nTreatment\\n• Possibly discontinuation of causative drugs (some may be necessary)\\n• Increase in dietary fiber\\n• Possibly trial with a brief course of osmotic laxatives\\nAny identified conditions should be treated.\\nAgents used to treat constipation are summarized in\\nTable 8-2\\n. Laxatives should be used judiciously. Some (eg, phosphate, bran, cellulose) bind drugs and\\ninterfere with absorption. Rapid fecal transit may rush some drugs and nutrients beyond their optimal\\nabsorptive locus. Contraindications to laxative and cathartic use include acute abdominal pain of\\nunknown origin, inflammatory bowel disorders, intestinal obstruction, GI bleeding, and fecal impaction.\\nDiet and behavior:\\n The diet should contain enough fiber (typically 15 to 20 g/day) to ensure adequate\\nstool bulk. Vegetable fiber, which is largely indigestible and unabsorbable, increases stool bulk. Certain\\ncomponents of fiber also absorb fluid, making stools softer and facilitating their passage. Fruits and\\nvegetables are recommended sources, as are cereals containing bran. Fiber supplementation is\\nparticularly effective in treating normal-transit constipation but is not very effective for slow-transit\\nconstipation or defecatory disorders.\\n[\\nTable 8-2.\\n Agents Used to Treat Constipation]\\nBehavioral changes may help. Patients should try to move their bowels at the same time daily, preferably\\n15 to 45 min after breakfast, because food ingestion stimulates colonic motility. Initial efforts at regular,\\nunhurried bowel movements may be aided by glycerin suppositories.\\nExplanation is important, but it is difficult to convince obsessive-compulsive patients that their attitude\\ntoward defecation is abnormal. Physicians must explain that daily bowel movements are not essential,\\nthat the bowel must be given a chance to function, and that frequent use of laxatives or enemas (> once/3\\ndays) denies the bowel that chance.\\nTypes of laxatives:\\n Bulking agents (eg, psyllium, Ca polycarbophil, methylcellulose) act slowly and\\ngently and are the safest agents for promoting elimination. Proper use involves gradually increasing the\\ndose—ideally taken tid or qid with sufficient liquid (eg, 500 mL/day of extra fluid) to prevent impaction\\n—until a softer, bulkier stool results. Bloating may be reduced by gradually titrating the dose of dietary\\nfiber to the recommended dose, or by switching to a synthetic fiber preparation such as methylcellulose.\\nOsmotic agents contain poorly absorbed polyvalent ions (eg, Mg, phosphate, sulfate), polymers (eg,\\npolyethylene glycol), or carbohydrates (eg, lactulose, sorbitol) that remain in the bowel, increasing\\nintraluminal osmotic pressure and thereby drawing water into the intestine. The increased volume\\nstimulates peristalsis. These agents usually work within 3 h.\\nIn general, osmotic laxatives are reasonably safe even when used regularly. However, Na phosphate\\nshould not be used for bowel cleansing because it may rarely cause acute renal failure even after a single\\nuse for bowel preparation. These events occurred primarily in elderly patients, those with preexisting\\nrenal disease, and those who were taking drugs that affect renal perfusion or function (eg, diuretics, ACE\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 8.

Also, Mg and phosphate are partially absorbed and may be\\ndetrimental in some conditions (eg, renal insufficiency). Na (in some preparations) may exacerbate heart\\nfailure. In large or frequent doses, these drugs may upset fluid and electrolyte balance. Another approach\\nto cleansing the bowel for diagnostic tests or surgery or sometimes for chronic constipation uses large\\nvolumes of a balanced osmotic agent (eg, polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution) given orally or via\\nNGT.\\nSecretory or stimulant cathartics (eg, phenolphthalein, bisacodyl, anthraquinones, castor oil,\\nanthraquinones) act by irritating the intestinal mucosa or by directly stimulating the submucosal and\\nmyenteric plexus. Although phenolphthalein was withdrawn from the US market after animal studies\\nsuggested the compound was carcinogenic, there is no epidemiologic evidence of this in humans.\\nBisacodyl is an effective rescue drug for chronic constipation. The anthraquinones senna, cascara\\nsagrada, aloe, and rhubarb are common constituents of herbal and OTC laxatives. They pass unchanged\\nto the colon where bacterial metabolism converts them to active forms. Adverse effects include allergic\\nreactions, electrolyte depletion, melanosis coli, and cathartic colon. Melanosis coli is a brownish black\\ncolorectal pigmentation of unknown composition. Cathartic colon refers to alterations in colonic anatomy\\nobserved on barium enema in patients with chronic stimulant laxative use. It is unclear whether cathartic\\ncolon, which has been attributed to destruction of myenteric plexus neurons by anthraquinones, is caused\\nby currently available agents or other neurotoxic agents (eg, podophyllin), which are no longer available.\\nThere does not seem to be an increased risk of colon cancer with long-term anthraquinone use.\\nEnemas can be used, including tap water and commercially prepared hypertonic solutions.\\nEmollient agents (eg, docusate, mineral oil) act slowly to soften stools, making them easier to pass.\\nHowever, they are not potent stimulators of defecation. Docusate is a surfactant, which allows water to\\nenter the fecal mass to soften and increase its bulk.\\nFecal impaction:\\n Fecal impaction is treated initially with enemas of tap water followed by small enemas\\n(100 mL) of commercially prepared hypertonic solutions (eg, Na phosphate). If these do not work, manual\\nfragmentation and disimpaction of the mass is necessary. This procedure is painful, so perirectal and\\nintrarectal application of local anesthetics (eg, lidocaine 5% ointment or dibucaine 1% ointment) is\\nrecommended. Some patients require sedation.\\nKey Points\\n• Drug causes are common (eg, chronic laxative abuse, use of anticholinergic or opioid drugs).\\n• Clinicians should be wary of bowel obstruction when constipation is acute and severe.\\n• Symptomatic treatment is reasonable in the absence of red flag findings and after excluding pelvic floor\\ndysfunction.\\nDyschezia\\n(Disordered Evacuation; Dysfunction of Pelvic Floor or Anal Sphincters; Functional Defecatory Disorders;\\nDyssynergia)\\nDyschezia is difficulty defecating. Patients sense the presence of stool and the need to\\ndefecate but are unable. It results from a lack of coordination of pelvic floor muscles and anal\\nsphincters. Diagnosis requires anorectal testing. Treatment is difficult, but biofeedback may be\\nof benefit.\\nEtiology\\nNormally, when a person tries to defecate, rectal pressure rises in coordination with relaxation of the\\nexternal anal sphincter. This process may be affected by one or more dysfunctions (eg, impaired rectal\\ncontraction, excessive contraction of the abdominal wall, paradoxic anal contraction, failure of anal\\nrelaxation) of unclear etiology.

Biofeedback therapy can improve coordination between abdominal\\ncontraction and pelvic floor relaxation during defecation, thereby alleviating symptoms. However, pelvic\\nfloor retraining for defecatory disorders is highly specialized and available at select centers only.

For diarrhea in children, see p. \\n2737\\n.)\\nStool is 60 to 90% water. In Western society, stool amount is 100 to 200 g/day in healthy adults and 10\\ng/kg/day in infants, depending on the amount of unabsorbable dietary material (mainly carbohydrates).\\nDiarrhea is defined as stool weight > 200 g/day. However, many people consider any increased stool\\nfluidity to be diarrhea. Alternatively, many people who ingest fiber have bulkier but formed stools but do\\nnot consider themselves to have diarrhea.\\nComplications:\\n Complications may result from diarrhea of any etiology. Fluid loss with consequent\\ndehydration, electrolyte loss (Na, K, Mg, Cl), and even vascular collapse sometimes occur. Collapse can\\ndevelop rapidly in patients who have severe diarrhea (eg, patients with cholera) or are very young, very\\nold, or debilitated. HCO\\n3\\n loss can cause metabolic acidosis. Hypokalemia can occur when patients have\\nsevere or chronic diarrhea or if the stool contains excess mucus.

Thus, even small reductions (ie, 1%) in intestinal\\nwater absorption or increases in secretion can increase water content enough to cause diarrhea.\\nThere are a number of causes of diarrhea (see\\nTable 8-3\\n). Several basic mechanisms are responsible for most clinically significant diarrheas: increased\\nosmotic load, increased secretions, and decreased contact time/surface area.

Such solutes include polyethylene glycol, Mg salts (hydroxide and sulfate), and Na\\nphosphate, which are used as laxatives. Osmotic diarrhea occurs with sugar intolerance (eg, lactose\\nintolerance caused by lactase deficiency). Ingesting large amounts of hexitols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol,\\nxylitol) or high fructose corn syrups, which are used as sugar substitutes in candy, gum, and fruit juices,\\ncauses osmotic diarrhea because hexitols are poorly absorbed. Lactulose, which is used as a laxative,\\ncauses diarrhea by a similar mechanism. Overingesting certain foodstuffs (see\\nTable 8-4\\n) can cause osmotic diarrhea.\\nIncreased secretions:\\n Diarrhea occurs when the bowels secrete more electrolytes and water than they\\nabsorb. Causes of increased secretions include infections, unabsorbed fats, certain drugs, and various\\nintrinsic and extrinsic secretagogues.\\nInfections (eg, gastroenteritis; discussed in \\nCh. 16\\n) are the most common causes of secretory diarrhea.\\nInfections combined with food poisoning are the most common causes of acute diarrhea (< 4 days in\\nduration). Most enterotoxins block Na\\n+\\n-H\\n+\\n exchange, which is an important driving force for fluid\\nabsorption in the small bowel and colon.\\nUnabsorbed dietary fat and bile acids (as in malabsorption syndromes and after ileal resection) can\\nstimulate colonic secretion and cause diarrhea.\\nDrugs may stimulate intestinal secretions directly (eg, quinidine, quinine, colchicine, anthraquinone\\ncathartics, castor oil, prostaglandins) or indirectly by impairing fat absorption (eg, orlistat).\\nVarious endocrine tumors produce secretagogues, including vipomas (vasoactive intestinal peptide),\\ngastrinomas (gastrin), mastocytosis (histamine), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (calcitonin and\\nprostaglandins), and carcinoid tumors (histamine, serotonin, and polypeptides). Some of these mediators\\n(eg, prostaglandins, serotonin, related compounds) also accelerate intestinal transit, colonic transit, or\\nboth.\\nReduced contact time/surface area:\\n Rapid intestinal transit and diminished surface area impair fluid\\nabsorption and cause diarrhea. Common causes include small-bowel or large-bowel resection or bypass,\\ngastric resection,\\n[\\nTable 8-4.\\n Dietary Factors that May Worsen Diarrhea]\\nand inflammatory bowel disease. Other causes include microscopic colitis (collagenous or lymphocytic\\ncolitis) and celiac sprue.\\nStimulation of intestinal smooth muscle by drugs (eg, Mg-containing antacids, laxatives, cholinesterase\\ninhibitors, SSRIs) or humoral agents (eg, prostaglandins, serotonin) also can speed transit.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory:\\n Duration and severity of diarrhea, circumstances of onset (including recent travel, food\\ningested, source of water), drug use (including any antibiotics within the previous 3 mo), abdominal pain\\nor vomiting, frequency and timing of bowel movements, changes in stool characteristics (eg, presence of\\nblood, pus, or mucus; changes in color or consistency; evidence of steatorrhea), associated changes in\\nweight or appetite, and rectal urgency or tenesmus should be noted.

Acute bloody diarrhea with or without hemodynamic instability in an otherwise healthy person\\nsuggests an enteroinvasive infection. Diverticular bleeding and ischemic colitis also manifest with acute\\nbloody diarrhea. Recurrent bouts of bloody diarrhea in a younger person suggest inflammatory bowel\\ndisease. In the absence of laxative use, large-volume diarrhea (eg, daily stool volume > 1 L/day) strongly\\nsuggests an endocrine cause in patients with normal GI anatomy. A history of oil droplets in stool,\\nparticularly if associated with weight loss, suggests malabsorption.\\nDiarrhea that consistently follows ingestion of certain foods (eg, fats) suggests food intolerance. Recent\\nantibiotic use should raise suspicion for antibiotic-associated diarrhea, including \\nClostridium difficile\\ncolitis.\\nThe symptoms can help identify the affected part of the bowel. Generally, in small-bowel diseases, stools\\nare voluminous and watery or fatty. In colonic diseases, stools are frequent, sometimes small in volume,\\nand possibly accompanied by blood, mucus, pus, and abdominal discomfort. In irritable bowel syndrome\\n(IBS), abdominal discomfort is relieved by defecation, associated with more loose or frequent stools, or\\nboth. However, these symptoms alone do not discriminate IBS from other diseases (eg, inflammatory\\nbowel disease). Patients with IBS or rectal mucosal involvement often have marked urgency, tenesmus,\\nand small, frequent stools (see p. \\n163\\n).\\nExtra-abdominal findings that suggest an etiology include skin lesions or flushing (mastocytosis), thyroid\\nnodules (medullary carcinoma of the thyroid), right-sided heart murmur (carcinoid), lymphadenopathy\\n(lymphoma, AIDS), and arthritis (inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease).\\nTesting:\\n Acute diarrhea (< 4 days) typically does not require testing. Exceptions are patients with signs of\\ndehydration, bloody stool, fever, severe pain, hypotension, or \\ntoxic features—particularly those who are\\nvery young or very old. These patients should have a CBC and measurement of electrolytes, BUN, and\\ncreatinine. Stool samples should be collected for microscopy, culture, fecal leukocyte testing, and, if\\nantibiotics have been taken recently, \\nC. difficile\\n toxin assay.\\nChronic diarrhea (> 4 wk) requires evaluation, as does a shorter (1 to 3 wk) bout of diarrhea in\\nimmunocompromised patients or those who appear significantly ill. Initial stool testing should include\\nculture, fecal leukocytes (detected by smear or measurement of fecal lactoferrin), microscopic\\nexamination for ova and parasites, pH (bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed carbohydrate lowers stool\\npH < 6.0), fat (by Sudan stain), and electrolytes (Na and K). If no standard pathogens are found, specific\\ntests for \\nGiardia\\n antigen and \\nAeromonas\\n, \\nPlesiomonas\\n, coccidia, and microsporidia should be requested.\\nSigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with biopsies should follow to look for inflammatory causes.\\nIf no diagnosis is apparent and Sudan stain is positive for fat, fecal fat excretion should be measured,\\nfollowed by small-bowel enteroclysis or CT enterography (structural disease) and endoscopic small-bowel\\nbiopsy (mucosal disease).

Thus, most nitrogen (N\\n2\\n) in the lumen originates from the bloodstream, and most H\\n2\\n in the\\nbloodstream originates from the lumen.\\nEtiology\\nThere are 3 main gas-related complaints: excessive belching, distention (bloating), and excessive flatus,\\neach with a number of causes (see\\nTable 8-5\\n). Infants 2 to 4 mo of age with recurrent crying spells often appear to observers to be in pain,\\nwhich in the past has been attributed to abdominal cramping or gas and termed colic. However, studies\\nshow no increase in H\\n2\\n production or in mouth-to-cecum transit times in colicky infants. Hence, the cause\\nof infantile colic remains unclear (see p. \\n2725\\n).\\nExcessive belching:\\n Belching (eructation) results from swallowed air or from gas generated by\\ncarbonated beverages. Aerophagia occurs normally in small amounts during eating and drinking, but\\nsome people unconsciously swallow air repeatedly while eating or smoking and at other times, especially\\nwhen anxious or in an attempt to induce belching. Excessive salivation increases aerophagia and may be\\nassociated with various GI disorders (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease), ill-fitting dentures, certain\\ndrugs, gum chewing, or nausea of any cause.\\nMost swallowed air is eructated. Only a small amount of swallowed air passes into the small bowel; the\\namount is apparently influenced by position. In an upright person, air is readily belched; in a supine\\nperson, air trapped above the stomach fluid tends to be propelled into the duodenum. Excessive\\neructation may also be voluntary; patients who belch after taking antacids may attribute the relief of\\nsymptoms to belching rather than to antacids and may intentionally belch to relieve distress.\\nDistention (bloating):\\n Abdominal bloating may occur in isolation or along with other GI symptoms in\\npatients with functional disorders (eg, aerophagia, nonulcer dyspepsia, gastroparesis, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome) or organic disorders (eg, ovarian cancer, colon cancer). However, excessive intestinal gas is\\nnot clearly linked to these complaints. In most healthy people, 1 L/h of gas can be infused into the gut\\nwith minimal symptoms. It is likely that many symptoms are incorrectly attributed to \"too much gas.\"\\nOn the other hand, some patients with recurrent GI symptoms often cannot tolerate small quantities of\\ngas: Retrograde colonic distention by balloon inflation or air instillation during colonoscopy often elicits\\nsevere discomfort in some patients (eg, those with irritable bowel syndrome) but minimal symptoms in\\nothers. Similarly, patients with eating disorders (eg, anorexia nervosa, bulimia) often misperceive and are\\nparticularly stressed by symptoms such as bloating. Thus, the basic abnormality in patients with gas-\\nrelated symptoms may be a hypersensitive intestine. Altered motility may contribute further to symptoms.\\nExcessive flatus:\\n There is great variability in the quantity and frequency of rectal gas passage. As with\\nstool frequency, people who complain of flatulence often have a misconception of what is normal. The\\naverage number of gas passages is about 13 to 21/day. Objectively recording flatus frequency (using a\\ndiary kept by the patient) is a first step in evaluation.\\nFlatus is a metabolic byproduct of intestinal bacteria; almost none originates from swallowed air or back-\\ndiffusion of gases (primarily N\\n2\\n) from the bloodstream. Bacterial metabolism yields significant volumes of\\nH\\n2\\n, CH\\n4\\n, and CO\\n2\\n.\\nH\\n2\\n is produced in large quantities in patients with malabsorption syndromes and after ingestion of certain\\nfruits and vegetables containing indigestible carbohydrates (eg, baked beans), sugars (eg, fructose), or\\nsugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol). In patients with disaccharidase deficiencies (most commonly lactase\\ndeficiency), large amounts of disaccharides pass into the colon and are fermented to H\\n2\\n. Celiac disease,\\ntropical sprue, pancreatic insufficiency, and other causes of carbohydrate malabsorption should also be\\nconsidered in cases of excess colonic gas.\\nCH\\n4\\n is also produced by colonic bacterial metabolism of the same foods (eg, dietary fiber). However,\\nabout 10% of people have bacteria that produce CH\\n4\\n but not H\\n2\\n.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 8.

Aromaticity is not a prominent feature.\\nRarely, this usually distressing symptom has been turned to advantage, as with a Frenchman referred to\\nas \"Le Petomane,\" who became affluent as an effluent performer who played tunes with the gas from his\\nrectum on the Moulin Rouge stage.\\nDrugs provide little benefit. Results with simethicone, an agent that breaks up small gas bubbles, and\\nvarious anticholinergics are poor. Some patients with dyspepsia and postprandial upper abdominal\\nfullness benefit from antacids, a low dose of tricyclic antidepressants (eg, nortriptyline 10 to 50 mg po\\nonce/day), or both to reduce visceral hypersensitivity.\\nComplaints of excess flatus are treated with avoidance of triggering substances (see \\nTable 8-5\\n).\\nRoughage (eg, bran, psyllium seed) may be added to the diet to try to increase colonic transit; however,\\nin some patients, worsening of symptoms may result. Activated charcoal can sometimes help reduce gas\\nand unpleasant odor; however, it stains clothing and the oral mucosa. Charcoal-lined undergarments are\\navailable. Probiotics (eg, VSL#3) may also reduce bloating and flatulence by modulating intestinal\\nbacterial flora. Antibiotics are useful in patients with documented bacterial overgrowth.\\nFunctional bloating, distention, and flatus may run an intermittent, chronic course that is only partially\\nrelieved by therapy. When appropriate, reassurance that these problems are not detrimental to health is\\nimportant.\\nKey Points\\n• Testing should be guided by the clinical features.\\n• Clinicians should be wary of new-onset, persistent symptoms in older patients.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 8.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic GI Procedures\\nIntroduction\\nDiagnostic tests and therapeutic procedures available for patients with GI disorders include acid-related\\ntests, endoscopy, laparoscopy, manometry, nuclear scans, x-ray contrast studies, nasogastric or intestinal\\nintubation, anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, abdominal paracentesis, electrogastrography, and electrical\\nimpedance testing. CT, MRI, and ultrasonography are also commonly done for GI disorders, and\\nsometimes angiography is used. The selection of procedures is discussed in subsequent chapters.\\nERCP, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, and liver biopsy are discussed in \\nCh. 24\\n.\\nAcid-Related Tests\\nAcid-related tests are used to ascertain the effectiveness of acid-blocking drugs. All require nasogastric or\\nnasoesophageal intubation. Complications are very rare. Patients must have nothing by mouth (npo) after\\nmidnight.\\nAmbulatory pH Monitoring\\nAmbulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring is currently the best available test for quantifying esophageal\\nacid exposure. The principal indications are\\n• To document excessive acid exposure in patients without endoscopic evidence of esophagitis\\n• To evaluate the effectiveness of medical or surgical treatments\\nA thin tube containing a pH probe is positioned 5 cm above the lower esophageal sphincter. The patient\\nrecords symptoms, meals, and sleep for 24 h. Esophageal acid exposure is defined by the percentage of\\nthe 24-h recording time that the pH is < 4.0. Values > 3.5% are considered abnormal. However, symptoms\\nmay not correlate with acid exposure or the presence of esophagitis. This may be because symptoms\\nmay result from nonacidic as well as acidic refluxate. Multichannel intraluminal impedance testing allows\\nfor recognition of major acid, minor acid, nonacid, and gas reflux, all of which can cause reflux symptoms.\\nGastric Analysis\\nSamples of stomach contents obtained via NGT are used to measure gastric acid output in a basal and\\nstimulated state. This information may be useful in a patient who develops a recurrent ulcer after surgical\\nvagotomy for peptic ulcer disease. In this case, a positive acid response to stimulation (sham feeding)\\nindicates an incomplete vagotomy. The test also is used to evaluate a patient with elevated serum gastrin\\nlevels. Hyperchlorhydria in the presence of elevated gastrin usually indicates Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.\\nHypochlorhydria in the presence of elevated gastrin indicates impairment of acid output, such as occurs\\nin pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, and Menetrier's disease and after inhibition of gastric acid\\nsecretion by potent antisecretory drugs.\\nTo do gastric analysis, an NGT is inserted and the gastric contents are aspirated and discarded. Gastric\\njuice is then collected for 1 h, divided into four 15-min samples. These samples represent basal acid\\noutput.\\nEndoscopy\\nFlexible endoscopes equipped with video cameras can be used to view the upper GI tract from pharynx to\\nupper duodenum and the lower GI tract from anus to cecum (and, sometimes, terminal ileum). Several\\nother diagnostic and therapeutic interventions also can be done endoscopically. The potential to combine\\ndiagnosis and therapy in one procedure gives endoscopy a significant advantage over procedures that\\nprovide only imaging (eg, x-ray contrast studies, CT, MRI) and often outweighs endoscopy's higher cost\\nand need for sedation.\\nDiagnostic procedures include the use of ultrasound-equipped endoscopes to evaluate blood flow or\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 9.

When the procedure is completed, the nitrous oxide\\nis expelled by the patient with a Valsalva maneuver and the cannula is removed. Complications can\\ninclude bleeding, bacterial peritonitis, and perforation of a viscus.\\nManometry\\nManometry is measurement of pressure within various parts of the GI tract. It is done by passing a\\ncatheter containing solid-state or liquid-filled pressure transducers through the mouth or anus into the\\nlumen of the organ to be studied. Manometry typically is done to evaluate motility disorders in patients in\\nwhom structural lesions have been ruled out by other studies. Manometry is used in the esophagus,\\nstomach and duodenum, sphincter of Oddi, and rectum. Aside from minor discomfort, complications are\\nvery rare. Patients must have nothing by mouth (npo) after midnight.\\nEsophageal manometry:\\n This test is used to evaluate patients with dysphagia, heartburn, or chest\\npain. It measures the pressure in the upper and lower esophageal sphincters, determines the\\neffectiveness and coordination of propulsive movements, and detects abnormal contractions. Manometry\\nis used to diagnose achalasia, diffuse spasm, systemic sclerosis, and lower esophageal sphincter\\nhypotension \\nand hypertension. It also is used to evaluate esophageal function before certain therapeutic\\nprocedures (eg, antireflux surgery, pneumatic dilation for achalasia).\\nGastroduodenal manometry:\\n In this test, transducers are placed in the gastric antrum, duodenum, and\\nproximal jejunum. Pressure is monitored for 5 to 24 h in both fasting and fed states. This test is used\\nmainly in patients who have symptoms suggestive of dysmotility but normal gastric emptying studies.\\nBarostat:\\n This is a pressure-sensing device that is placed in the stomach to measure gastric\\naccommodation. The device consists of a plastic balloon and an electronic controller that varies the\\namount of air in the balloon to maintain constant pressure. This device is used mainly in research studies\\nassessing sensory threshold and altered visceral perception, particularly in functional GI disorders.\\nAnorectal manometry:\\n This test evaluates the anorectal sphincter mechanism and rectal sensation in\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 9.

Single-contrast\\nstudies fill the lumen with radiopaque material, outlining the structure. Better, more detailed images are\\nobtained from double-contrast studies, in which a small amount of high-density barium coats the mucosal\\nsurface and gas distends the organ and enhances contrast. The gas is injected by the operator in double-\\ncontrast barium enema, whereas in other studies, intrinsic GI tract gas is adequate. In all cases, patients\\nturn themselves to properly distribute the gas and barium. Fluoroscopy can monitor the progress of the\\ncontrast material. Either video or plain films can be taken for documentation, but video is particularly\\nuseful when assessing motor disorders (eg, cricopharyngeal spasm, achalasia).\\nThe main contraindication to x-ray contrast studies is suspected perforation, because free barium is\\nhighly irritating to the mediastinum and peritoneum; water-soluble contrast is less irritating and may be\\nused if perforation is possible.

A topical\\nanesthetic sprayed in the nose and pharynx helps reduce discomfort. With the patient's head partially\\nflexed, the lubricated tube is inserted through the nares and aimed back and then down to conform to the\\nnasopharynx. As the tip reaches the posterior pharyngeal wall, the patient should sip water through a\\nstraw. Violent coughing with flow of air through the tube during respiration indicates that the tube is\\nmisplaced in the trachea. Aspiration of gastric juice verifies entry into the stomach. The position of larger\\ntubes can be confirmed by instilling 20 to 30 mL of air and listening with the stethoscope under the left\\nsubcostal region for a rush of air.\\nSome smaller, more flexible intestinal feeding tubes require the use of stiffening wires or stylets.

GI Bleeding\\nIntroduction\\nGI bleeding can originate anywhere from the mouth to the anus and can be overt or occult. The\\nmanifestations depend on the location and rate of bleeding.\\nHematemesis is vomiting of red blood and indicates upper GI bleeding, usually from an arterial source or\\nvarix. Coffee-ground emesis is vomiting of dark brown, granular material that resembles coffee grounds. It\\nresults from upper GI bleeding that has slowed or stopped, with conversion of red Hb to brown hematin\\nby gastric acid.\\nHematochezia is the passage of gross blood from the rectum and usually indicates lower GI bleeding but\\nmay result from vigorous upper GI bleeding with rapid transit of blood through the intestines.\\nMelena is black, tarry stool and typically indicates upper GI bleeding, but bleeding from a source in the\\nsmall bowel or right colon may also be the cause. About 100 to 200 mL of blood in the upper GI tract is\\nrequired to cause \\nmelena, which may persist for several days after bleeding has ceased. Black stool that\\ndoes not contain occult blood may result from ingestion of iron, bismuth, or various foods and should not\\nbe mistaken for melena.\\nChronic occult bleeding can occur from anywhere in the GI tract and is detectable by chemical testing of a\\nstool specimen. Acute, severe bleeding also can occur from anywhere in the GI tract. Patients may\\npresent with signs of shock. Those with underlying ischemic heart disease may develop angina or MI\\nbecause of hypoperfusion.\\nGI bleeding may precipitate portal-systemic encephalopathy (see p. \\n220\\n) or hepatorenal syndrome\\n(kidney failure secondary to liver failure—see p. \\n223\\n).\\nEtiology\\nThere are many possible causes (see\\nTable 10-1\\n), which are divided into upper GI (above the ligament of Treitz), lower GI, and small bowel.\\nBleeding of any cause is more likely, and potentially more severe, in patients with chronic liver disease\\n(eg, caused by alcohol abuse or chronic hepatitis), in those with hereditary coagulation disorders, or in\\nthose taking certain drugs. Drugs associated with GI bleeding include anticoagulants (eg, heparin,\\nwarfarin), those affecting platelet function (eg, aspirin and certain other NSAIDs, clopidogrel, SSRIs), and\\nthose affecting mucosal defenses (eg, NSAIDs).\\nEvaluation\\nStabilization with airway management, IV fluids, or transfusions is essential before and during diagnostic\\nevaluation.\\nHistory: History of present illness\\n should attempt to ascertain quantity and frequency of blood\\npassage. However, quantity can be difficult to assess because even small amounts (5 to 10 mL) of blood\\nturn water in a toilet bowl an opaque red, and modest amounts of vomited blood appear huge to an\\nanxious patient. However, most can distinguish among blood streaks, a few teaspoons, and clots.\\nPatients with hematemesis should be asked whether blood was passed with initial vomiting or only after\\nan initial (or several) nonbloody emesis.\\nPatients with rectal bleeding should be asked whether pure blood was passed; whether it was mixed with\\nstool, pus, or mucus; or whether blood simply coated the stool. Those with bloody diarrhea should be\\nasked about travel or other possible exposure to GI pathogens.\\n[\\nTable 10-1.\\n Common Causes of GI Bleeding]\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 10.

Type and crossmatch are done if bleeding is ongoing. Hb and Hct may\\nbe repeated up to every 6 h in patients with severe bleeding. Additionally, one or more diagnostic\\nprocedures are typically required.\\nNasogastric aspiration and lavage should be done in all patients with suspected upper GI bleeding (eg,\\nhematemesis, coffee-ground emesis, melena, massive rectal bleeding). Bloody nasogastric aspirate\\nindicates active upper GI bleeding, but about 10% of patients with upper GI bleeding have no blood in the\\nnasogastric aspirate.

Admission to an ICU, with\\nconsultation by both a gastroenterologist and a surgeon, is recommended for all patients with severe GI\\nbleeding. General treatment is directed at maintenance of the airway and restoration of circulating\\nvolume. Hemostasis and other treatment depend on the cause of the bleeding.\\nAirway:\\n A major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with active upper GI bleeding is aspiration of\\nblood with subsequent respiratory compromise. To prevent these problems, endotracheal intubation\\nshould be considered in patients who have inadequate gag reflexes or are obtunded or unconscious\\n—particularly if they will be undergoing upper endoscopy.\\nFluid resuscitation:\\n IV fluids are initiated as for any patient with hypovolemia or hemorrhagic shock (see\\np. \\n2297\\n): healthy adults are given normal saline IV in 500- to 1000-mL aliquots until signs of hypovolemia\\nremit—up to a maximum of 2 L (for children, 20 mL/kg, that may be repeated once). Patients requiring\\nfurther resuscitation should receive transfusion with packed RBCs. Transfusions continue until\\nintravascular volume is restored and then are given as needed to replace ongoing blood loss.\\nTransfusions in older patients or those with coronary artery disease may be stopped when Hct is stable at\\n30 unless the patient is symptomatic. Younger patients or those with chronic bleeding are usually not\\ntransfused unless Hct is < 23 or they have symptoms such as dyspnea or coronary ischemia.\\nPlatelet count should be monitored closely; platelet transfusion may be required with severe bleeding.\\nPatients who are taking antiplatelet drugs (eg, clopidogrel, aspirin) have platelet dysfunction, often\\nresulting in increased bleeding. Platelet transfusion should be considered when patients taking these\\ndrugs have severe ongoing bleeding, although a residual circulating drug (particularly clopidogrel) may\\ninactivate transfused platelets. Fresh frozen plasma should be transfused after every 4 units of packed\\nRBCs.\\nHemostasis:\\n GI bleeding stops spontaneously in about 80% of patients. The remaining patients require\\nsome type of intervention. Specific therapy depends on the bleeding site. Early intervention to control\\nbleeding is important to minimize mortality, particularly in elderly patients.\\nFor peptic ulcer, ongoing bleeding or rebleeding is treated with endoscopic coagulation (with bipolar\\nelectrocoagulation, injection sclerotherapy, heater probes, or laser). Non-bleeding vessels that are visible\\nwithin an ulcer crater are also treated. If endoscopy does not stop the bleeding, surgery is required to\\noversew the bleeding site. If medical management does not control gastric acid secretion, surgeons do\\nacid-reduction surgery (see p. \\n136\\n) at the same time.\\nActive variceal bleeding can be treated with endoscopic banding, injection sclerotherapy, or a transjugular\\nintrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) procedure.\\nSevere, ongoing lower GI bleeding caused by diverticula or angiomas can sometimes be controlled\\ncolonoscopically by electrocautery, coagulation with a heater probe, or injection with dilute epinephrine.\\nPolyps can be removed by snare or cautery. If these methods are ineffective or unfeasible, angiography\\nwith embolization or vasopressin infusion may be successful. However, because collateral blood flow to\\nthe bowel is limited, angiographic techniques have a significant risk of bowel ischemia or infarction unless\\nsuper-selective catheterization techniques are used. \\nIn most series, the rate of ischemic complications is\\n< 5%. Vasopressin infusion has about an 80% success rate for stopping bleeding, but bleeding recurs in\\nabout 50% of patients. Also, there is a risk of hypertension and coronary ischemia. Furthermore,\\nangiography can be used to localize the source of bleeding more accurately. Surgery may be used in\\npatients with continued bleeding (requiring > 4 units transfusion/24 h), but localization of the bleeding site\\nis very important.

Variceal\\nbleeding is less common than in younger patients.\\nMassive GI bleeding is tolerated poorly by elderly patients. Diagnosis must be made quickly, and\\ntreatment must be started sooner than in younger patients, who can better tolerate repeated episodes of\\nbleeding.\\nKey Points\\n• Rectal bleeding may result from upper or lower GI bleeding.\\n• Orthostatic changes in vital signs are unreliable markers for serious bleeding.\\n• About 80% of patients stop bleeding spontaneously; various endoscopic techniques are usually the first\\nchoice for the remainder.\\nVarices\\nVarices are dilated veins in the distal esophagus or proximal stomach caused by elevated\\npressure in the portal venous system, typically from cirrhosis. They may bleed massively but\\ncause no other symptoms. Diagnosis is by upper endoscopy. Treatment is primarily with\\nendoscopic banding and IV octreotide. Sometimes a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic\\nshunting procedure is needed.\\nPortal hypertension (see p. \\n218\\n) results from a number of conditions, predominantly liver cirrhosis. If\\nportal pressure remains higher than inferior vena caval pressure for a significant period, venous\\ncollaterals develop. The most dangerous collaterals occur in the distal esophagus and gastric fundus,\\ncausing engorged, serpentine submucosal vessels known as varices. These varices partially decompress\\nportal hypertension but can rupture, causing massive GI bleeding. The trigger for variceal rupture is\\nunknown, but bleeding almost never occurs unless the portal/systemic pressure gradient is > 12 mm Hg.\\nCoagulopathies caused by liver disease may facilitate bleeding. NGT passage in a patient with varices\\nhas not been shown to trigger bleeding.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPatients typically present with sudden, painless, upper GI bleeding, often massive. Signs of shock may be\\npresent. Bleeding is usually from the distal esophagus, less often from the gastric fundus.

Nevertheless, mortality is high, often >\\n50%. Mortality depends primarily on severity of the associated liver disease rather than on the bleeding\\nitself. Bleeding is often fatal in patients with severe hepatocellular impairment (eg, advanced cirrhosis),\\nwhereas patients with good hepatic reserve usually recover.\\nSurviving patients are at high risk of further variceal bleeding; typically, 50 to 75% have recurrence within\\n1 to 2 yr. Ongoing endoscopic or drug therapy significantly lowers this risk, but the overall effect on long-\\nterm mortality seems to be marginal, probably because of the underlying hepatic disease.\\nTreatment\\n• Fluid resuscitation\\n• Endoscopic banding (sclerotherapy second choice)\\n• IV octreotide\\n• Possibly a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) procedure\\nManagement of hypovolemia and hemorrhagic shock is as described above and in \\nCh. 226\\n. Patients with\\ncoagulation abnormalities (eg, elevated INR) should be given 1 to 2 units of fresh frozen plasma and 2.5\\nto 10 mg vitamin K IM (or IV if severe).\\nBecause varices are invariably diagnosed during endoscopy, primary treatment is endoscopic.\\nEndoscopic banding of varices is preferred over injection sclerotherapy. At the same time, IV octreotide (a\\nsynthetic analog of somatostatin, which may also be used) should be given. Octreotide increases\\nsplanchnic vascular resistance by inhibiting the release of splanchnic vasodilator hormones (eg,\\nglucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide). The usual dose is a 50 \\nμ\\ng IV bolus, followed by infusion of 50\\nμ\\ng/h. Octreotide is preferred over previously used agents such as vasopressin and terlipressin, because\\nit has fewer adverse effects.\\nIf bleeding continues or recurs despite these measures, emergency techniques to shunt blood from the\\nportal system to the vena cava can lower portal pressure and diminish bleeding. A TIPS procedure is the\\nemergency intervention of choice. TIPS is an invasive radiologic procedure in which a guidewire is\\npassed from the vena cava through the liver parenchyma into the portal circulation. The resultant\\npassage is dilated by a balloon catheter, and a metallic stent is inserted, creating a bypass between the\\nportal and hepatic venous circulations. Stent size is crucial. If the stent is too large, portal-systemic\\nencephalopathy results because of diversion of too much portal blood flow from the liver. If the stent is\\ntoo small, it is more likely to occlude. Surgical portacaval shunts, such as the distal spleno-renal shunt,\\nwork by a similar mechanism but are more invasive and have a higher immediate mortality.\\nMechanical compression of bleeding varices with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or one of its variants\\ncauses considerable morbidity and should not be used as primary management. However, such a tube\\nmay provide life-saving tamponade pending decompression with a TIPS or surgical procedure. The tube\\nis a flexible NGT with one gastric balloon and one esophageal balloon. After insertion, the gastric balloon\\nis inflated with a fixed volume of air, and traction is applied to the tube to pull the balloon snugly against\\nthe gastroesophageal junction. This balloon is often sufficient to control bleeding, but if not, the\\nesophageal balloon is inflated to a pressure of 25 mm Hg. The procedure is quite uncomfortable and may\\nresult in esophageal perforation and aspiration; thus, endotracheal intubation and IV sedation are often\\nrecommended.\\nLiver transplantation can also decompress the portal system but is a practical option only for patients\\nalready on a transplant list.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 10.

Acute Abdomen and Surgical Gastroenterology\\nIntroduction\\nAcute abdomen refers to abdominal symptoms and signs of such severity or concern that disorders\\nrequiring surgery should be considered. The primary symptom is acute abdominal pain. Chronic\\nabdominal pain is discussed in \\nCh. 7\\n.\\nAcute Abdominal Pain\\nAbdominal pain is common and often inconsequential. Acute and severe abdominal pain, however, is\\nalmost always a symptom of intra-abdominal disease. It may be the sole indicator of the need for surgery\\nand must be attended to swiftly: Gangrene and perforation of the gut can occur < 6 h from onset of\\nsymptoms in certain conditions (eg, interruption of the intestinal blood supply caused by a strangulating\\nobstruction or an arterial embolus). Abdominal pain is of particular concern in patients who are very young\\nor very old and those who have HIV infection or are taking immunosuppressants.\\nTextbook descriptions of abdominal pain have limitations because people react to pain differently. Some,\\nparticularly elderly people, are stoic, whereas others exaggerate their symptoms. Infants, young children,\\nand some elderly people may have difficulty localizing the pain.\\nPathophysiology\\nVisceral pain\\n comes from the abdominal viscera, which are innervated by autonomic nerve fibers and\\nrespond mainly to the sensations of distention and muscular contraction—not to cutting, tearing, or local\\nirritation. Visceral pain is typically vague, dull, and nauseating. It is poorly localized and tends to be\\nreferred to areas corresponding to the embryonic origin of the affected structure. Foregut structures\\n(stomach, duodenum, liver, and pancreas) cause upper abdominal pain. Midgut structures (small bowel,\\nproximal colon, and appendix) \\ncause periumbilical pain. Hindgut structures (distal colon and GU tract)\\ncause lower abdominal pain.\\nSomatic pain\\n comes from the parietal peritoneum, which is innervated by somatic nerves, which respond\\nto irritation from infectious, chemical, or other inflammatory processes. Somatic pain is sharp and well\\nlocalized.\\nReferred pain\\n is pain perceived distant from its source and results from convergence of nerve fibers at\\nthe spinal cord. Common examples of referred pain are scapular pain due to biliary colic, groin pain due\\nto renal colic, and shoulder pain due to blood or infection irritating the diaphragm.\\nPeritonitis:\\n Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneal cavity. The most serious cause is perforation of\\nthe GI tract (see p. \\n111\\n), which causes immediate chemical inflammation followed shortly by infection from\\nintestinal organisms. Peritonitis can also result from any abdominal condition that causes marked\\ninflammation (eg, appendicitis, diverticulitis, strangulating intestinal obstruction, pancreatitis, pelvic\\ninflammatory disease, mesenteric ischemia). Intraperitoneal blood from any source (eg, ruptured\\naneurysm, trauma, surgery, ectopic pregnancy) is irritating and results in peritonitis. Barium causes\\nsevere peritonitis and should never be given to a patient with suspected GI tract perforation. Peritoneo-\\nsystemic shunts, drains, and dialysis catheters in the peritoneal cavity predispose a patient to infectious\\nperitonitis, as does ascitic fluid. Rarely, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis occurs, in which the peritoneal\\ncavity is infected by blood-borne bacteria.\\nPeritonitis causes fluid shift into the peritoneal cavity and bowel, leading to severe dehydration and\\nelectrolyte disturbances. Adult respiratory distress syndrome can develop rapidly. Kidney failure, liver\\nfailure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation follow. The patient's face becomes drawn into the\\nmasklike appearance typical of hippocratic facies. Death occurs within days.\\nEtiology\\nMany intra-abdominal disorders cause abdominal pain (see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 11. Acute Abdomen & Surgical Gastroenterology\\n158\"),\n",

These include ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), perforated viscus, mesenteric\\nischemia, and ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Others (eg, intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, severe acute\\npancreatitis) are also serious and nearly as urgent. Several extra-abdominal disorders also cause\\nabdominal pain (see\\nTable 11-1\\n).\\nAbdominal pain in neonates, infants, and young children has numerous causes not encountered in adults,\\nincluding meconium peritonitis, pyloric stenosis, esophageal webs, volvulus of a gut with a common\\nmesentery, imperforate anus, intussusception, and intestinal obstruction caused by atresia.\\nEvaluation\\nEvaluation of mild and severe pain follows the same process, although with severe abdominal pain,\\ntherapy sometimes proceeds simultaneously and involves early consultation with a surgeon. History and\\nphysical examination usually exclude all but a few possible causes, with final diagnosis confirmed by\\njudicious use of laboratory and imaging tests. Life-threatening causes should always be ruled out before\\nfocusing on less serious diagnoses. In seriously ill patients with severe abdominal pain, the most\\nimportant diagnostic measure may be expeditious surgical exploration. In mildly ill patients, watchful\\nwaiting may be best.\\nHistory:\\n A thorough history usually suggests the diagnosis (see\\nTable 11-2\\n). Of particular importance are pain location (see \\nFig. 11-1\\n) and characteristics, history of\\nsimilar symptoms, and associated symptoms. Concomitant symptoms such as gastroesophageal reflux,\\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, jaundice, melena, hematuria, hematemesis, weight loss, and\\nmucus or blood in the stool help direct subsequent evaluation. A drug history should include details\\nconcerning prescription and illicit drug use as well as alcohol. Many drugs cause GI upset. Prednisone or\\nimmunosuppressants may inhibit the inflammatory response to perforation or peritonitis and result in less\\npain and leukocytosis than might otherwise be expected. Anticoagulants can increase the chances of\\nbleeding and hematoma formation. Alcohol predisposes to pancreatitis.\\nKnown medical conditions and previous abdominal surgeries are important to ascertain. Women should\\nbe asked whether they are pregnant.\\nPhysical examination:\\n The general appearance is important. A happy, comfortable-appearing patient\\nrarely has a serious problem, unlike one who is anxious, pale, diaphoretic, or in obvious pain.

A bedside urine pregnancy test should be done\\nfor all women of childbearing age because a negative result effectively excludes ruptured ectopic\\npregnancy.\\nAn abdominal series, consisting of flat and upright abdominal x-rays and upright chest x-rays (left lateral\\nrecumbent abdomen and anteroposterior chest x-ray for patients unable to stand), should be done when\\nperforation or obstruction is suspected.

It leads to mediator release, inflammation, and ultimately infarction. Abdominal\\npain is out of proportion to physical findings. Early diagnosis is difficult, but angiography and\\nexploratory laparotomy have the most sensitivity; other imaging modalities often become\\npositive only late in the disease. Treatment is by embolectomy, revascularization of viable\\nsegments, or resection; sometimes vasodilator therapy is successful. Mortality is high.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe intestinal mucosa has a high metabolic rate and, accordingly, a high blood flow requirement (normally\\nreceiving 20 to 25% of cardiac output), making it very sensitive to the effects of decreased perfusion.\\nIschemia disrupts the mucosal barrier, allowing release of bacteria, toxins, and vasoactive mediators,\\nwhich in turn leads to myocardial depression, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (see p. \\n2299\\n),\\nmultisystem organ failure, and death. Mediator release may occur even before complete infarction.\\nNecrosis can occur as soon as 10 to 12 h after the onset of symptoms.\\nThree major vessels serve the abdominal contents: the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery\\n(SMA), and the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). The celiac trunk supplies the esophagus, stomach,\\nproximal duodenum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen. The SMA supplies the distal duodenum,\\njejunum, ileum, and colon to the splenic flexure. The IMA supplies the descending colon and sigmoid\\ncolon and the rectum. Collateral vessels are abundant in the stomach, duodenum, and rectum; these\\nareas rarely develop ischemia. The splenic flexure is a watershed between the SMA and IMA and is at\\nparticular risk of ischemia.\\nEtiology\\nMesenteric blood flow may be disrupted on either the venous or arterial sides. In general, patients > 50\\nare at greatest risk and have the types of occlusions and risk factors shown in\\nTable 11-3\\n. However, many patients have no identifiable risk factors.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe early hallmark of mesenteric ischemia is severe pain but minimal physical findings. The abdomen\\nremains soft, with little or no tenderness. Mild tachycardia may be present. Later, as necrosis develops,\\nsigns of peritonitis appear, with marked abdominal tenderness, guarding, rigidity, and no bowel sounds.\\nThe stool may be heme-positive (increasingly likely as ischemia progresses).

The obstruction leads to\\ndistention, bacterial overgrowth, ischemia, and inflammation. If untreated, necrosis, gangrene, and\\nperforation occur. If the perforation is contained by the omentum, an appendiceal abscess results.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe classic symptoms of acute appendicitis are epigastric or periumbilical pain followed by brief nausea,\\nvomiting, and anorexia; after a few hours, the pain shifts to the right lower quadrant. Pain increases with\\ncough and motion. \\nClassic signs are right lower quadrant direct and rebound tenderness located at\\nMcBurney's point (junction of the middle and outer thirds of the line joining the umbilicus to the anterior\\nsuperior spine). Additional signs are pain felt in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower\\nquadrant (Rovsing sign), an increase in pain from passive extension of the right hip joint that stretches\\nthe iliopsoas muscle (psoas sign), or pain caused by passive internal rotation of the flexed thigh\\n(obturator sign). Low-grade fever (rectal temperature 37.7 to 38.3° C [100 to 101° F]) is common.\\nUnfortunately, these classic findings appear in < 50% of patients. Many variations of symptoms and signs\\noccur.

The surgeon can\\nusually remove the appendix even if perforated. Occasionally, the appendix is difficult to locate: In these\\ncases, it usually lies behind the cecum or the ileum and mesentery of the right colon. A contraindication to\\nappendectomy is inflammatory bowel disease involving the cecum. However, in cases of terminal ileitis\\nand a normal cecum, the appendix should be removed.\\nAppendectomy should be preceded by IV antibiotics. Third-generation cephalosporins are preferred. For\\nnonperforated appendicitis, no further antibiotics are required. If the appendix is perforated, antibiotics\\nshould be continued until the patient's temperature and WBC count have normalized or continued for a\\nfixed course, according to the surgeon's preference. If surgery is impossible, antibiotics—although not\\ncurative—markedly improve the survival rate. When a large inflammatory mass is found involving the\\nappendix, terminal ileum, and cecum, resection of the entire mass and ileocolostomy are preferable. In\\nlate cases in which a pericolic abscess has already formed, the abscess is drained either by an\\nultrasound-guided percutaneous catheter or by open operation (with appendectomy to follow at a later\\ndate). A Meckel's diverticulum in a patient under the age of 40 should be removed concomitantly with the\\nappendectomy unless extensive inflammation around the appendix prevents the procedure.\\nHernias of the Abdominal Wall\\nA hernia of the abdominal wall is a protrusion of the abdominal contents through an acquired or\\ncongenital area of weakness or defect in the wall. Many hernias are asymptomatic, but some\\nbecome incarcerated or strangulated, causing pain and requiring immediate surgery. Diagnosis\\nis clinical. Treatment is elective surgical repair.\\nAbdominal hernias are extremely common, particularly among males, necessitating about 700,000\\noperations each year in the US.\\nClassification\\nAbdominal hernias are classified as either abdominal wall or groin hernias. Strangulated hernias are\\nischemic from physical constriction of their blood supply. Gangrene, perforation, and peritonitis may\\ndevelop. Incarcerated and strangulated hernias cannot be reduced manually.\\nAbdominal wall hernias include umbilical hernias, epigastric hernias, Spigelian hernias, and incisional\\n(ventral) hernias. Umbilical hernias (protrusions through the umbilical ring) are mostly congenital, but\\nsome are acquired in adulthood secondary to obesity, ascites, pregnancy, or chronic peritoneal dialysis.\\nEpigastric hernias occur through the linea alba. Spigelian hernias occur through defects in the\\ntransversus abdominis muscle lateral to the rectus sheath, usually below the level of the umbilicus.\\nIncisional hernias occur through an incision from previous abdominal surgery.\\nGroin hernias include inguinal hernias and femoral hernias. Inguinal hernias occur above the inguinal\\nligament. Indirect inguinal hernias traverse the internal inguinal ring into the inguinal canal, and direct\\ninguinal hernias extend directly forward and do not pass through the inguinal canal. Femoral hernias\\noccur below the inguinal ligament and go into the femoral canal.\\nAbout 75% of all abdominal hernias are inguinal. Incisional hernias comprise another 10 to 15%. Femoral\\nand unusual hernias account for the remaining 10 to 15%.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost patients complain only of a visible bulge, which may cause vague discomfort or be asymptomatic.\\nMost hernias, even large ones, can be manually reduced with persistent gentle pressure; placing the\\npatient in the Trendelenburg position may help.

Very large defects may be repaired electively after age 2 yr.

Maintaining an adequate serum\\nK level (> 4 mEq/L [> 4 mmol/L]) is especially important. Ileus persisting > 1 wk probably has a\\nmechanical obstructive cause, and laparotomy should be considered.

Some clinicians use IV neostigmine (requires cardiac monitoring) to treat\\nOgilvie's syndrome.\\nIntestinal Obstruction\\nIntestinal obstruction is significant mechanical impairment or complete arrest of the passage of\\ncontents through the intestine. Symptoms include cramping pain, vomiting, obstipation, and\\nlack of flatus. Diagnosis is clinical, confirmed by abdominal x-rays. Treatment is fluid\\nresuscitation, nasogastric suction, and, in most cases of complete obstruction, surgery.\\nMechanical obstruction is divided into obstruction of the small bowel (including the duodenum) and\\nobstruction of the large bowel. Obstruction may be partial or complete. About 85% of partial small-bowel\\nobstructions resolve with nonoperative treatment, whereas about 85% of complete small-bowel\\nobstructions require operation.\\nEtiology\\nOverall, the most common causes of mechanical obstruction are adhesions, hernias, and tumors.

Patients with partial obstruction may develop diarrhea. Severe, steady pain suggests that\\nstrangulation has occurred. In the absence of strangulation, the abdomen is not tender.

Esophageal and Swallowing Disorders\\nIntroduction\\n(See also \\nEsophageal Cancer\\n on p. \\n186\\n and \\nEsophageal Atresia\\n on p. \\n2975\\n.)\\nThe swallowing apparatus consists of the pharynx, upper esophageal (cricopharyngeal) sphincter, the\\nbody of the esophagus, and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The upper third of the esophagus\\nand the structures proximal to it are composed of skeletal muscle; the distal esophagus and LES are\\ncomposed of smooth muscle. These components work as an integrated system that transports material\\nfrom the mouth to the stomach and prevents its reflux into the esophagus. Physical obstruction or\\ndisorders that interfere with motor function (motility disorders) can affect the system.\\nThe patient's history suggests the diagnosis almost 80% of the time. The only physical findings in\\nesophageal disorders are cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy caused by metastasis, swellings\\nin the neck caused by large pharyngeal diverticula or thyromegaly, and prolonged swallowing time (the\\ntime from the act of swallowing to the sound of the bolus of fluid and air entering the stomach—normally ≤\\n12 sec—heard by auscultation with the stethoscope over the epigastrium). Watching the patient swallow\\nmay help diagnose aspiration or nasal regurgitation. Most esophageal disorders require specific tests for\\ndiagnosis.\\nDysphagia\\nDysphagia is difficulty swallowing. The condition results from impeded transport of liquids, solids, or both\\nfrom the pharynx to the stomach. Dysphagia should not be confused with globus sensation (see p. \\n78\\n), a\\nfeeling of having a lump in the throat, which is unrelated to swallowing and occurs without impaired\\ntransport.\\nComplications:\\n Dysphagia can lead to tracheal aspiration of ingested material, oral secretions, or both.\\nAspiration can cause acute pneumonia; recurrent aspiration may eventually lead to chronic lung disease.\\nProlonged dysphagia often leads to inadequate nutrition and weight loss.\\nEtiology\\nDysphagia is classified as oropharyngeal or esophageal, depending on where it occurs.\\nOropharyngeal dysphagia:\\n Oropharyngeal dysphagia is difficulty emptying material from the\\noropharynx into the esophagus; it results from abnormal function proximal to the esophagus. Patients\\ncomplain of difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and tracheal aspiration followed by\\ncoughing.\\nMost often, oropharyngeal dysphagia occurs in patients with neurologic conditions or muscular disorders\\nthat affect skeletal muscles (see\\nTable 12-1\\n).\\nEsophageal dysphagia:\\n Esophageal dysphagia is difficulty passing food down the esophagus. It results\\nfrom either a motility disorder or a mechanical obstruction (see\\nTable 12-2\\n).\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: History of present illness\\n begins with duration of symptoms and acuity of onset. Patients\\nshould describe what substances cause difficulty and where they feel the disturbance is located. Specific\\nconcerns include whether patients have difficulty swallowing solids, liquids, or both; whether food comes\\nout their nose; whether they drool or have food spill from their mouth; and whether they cough or choke\\nwhile eating.\\n[\\nTable 12-1.\\n Some Causes of Oropharyngeal Dysphagia]\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 12.

Patients who describe easy fatigability should be observed performing a repetitive action (eg,\\nblinking, counting aloud) for a rapid decrement in performance.\\n[\\nTable 12-2.\\n Some Causes of Esophageal Dysphagia]\\nThe patient's gait should be observed, and balance should be tested. Skin is examined for rash and\\nthickening or texture changes, particularly on the fingertips. Muscles are inspected for wasting and\\nfasciculations and are palpated for tenderness.

Dysphagia for solids alone suggests mechanical obstruction; however, a problem\\nwith both solids and liquids is nonspecific. Drooling and spilling food from the mouth while eating or nasal\\nregurgitation suggests an oropharyngeal disorder.

If this\\ntest shows obstruction, endoscopy (and possibly biopsy) should be done to rule out malignancy. If the\\nbarium swallow is negative or suggestive of a motility disorder, esophageal motility studies should be\\ndone. Other tests for specific causes are done as suggested by findings.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is directed at the specific cause. If complete obstruction occurs, emergent upper endoscopy is\\nessential.

Patients with\\nsevere dysphagia and recurrent aspiration may require a gastrostomy tube.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nChewing, swallowing, tasting, and communicating require intact, coordinated neuromuscular function in\\nthe mouth, face, and neck. Oral motor function in particular declines measurably with aging, even in\\nhealthy people. Decline in function may have many manifestations:\\n• Reduction in masticatory muscle strength and coordination is common, especially among patients with\\npartial or complete dentures, and may lead to a tendency to swallow larger food particles, which can\\nincrease the risk of choking or aspiration.\\n• Drooping of the lower face and lips caused by decreased circumoral muscle tone and, in edentulous\\npeople, reduced bone support, is an aesthetic concern and can lead to drooling, spilling of food and\\nliquids, and difficulty closing the lips while eating, sleeping, or resting. Sialorrhea (saliva leakage) is\\noften the first symptom.\\n• Swallowing difficulties increase. It takes longer to move food from mouth to oropharynx, which increases\\nthe likelihood of aspiration.\\nAfter age-related changes, the most common causes of oral motor disorders are neuromuscular disorders\\n(eg, cranial neuropathies caused by diabetes, stroke, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,\\nmultiple sclerosis). Iatrogenic causes also contribute. Drugs (eg, anticholinergics, diuretics), radiation\\ntherapy to the head and neck, and chemotherapy can greatly impair saliva production.

Factors\\ncontributing to reflux include weight gain, fatty foods, caffeinated or carbonated beverages, alcohol,\\ntobacco smoking, and drugs. Drugs that lower LES pressure include anticholinergics, antihistamines,\\ntricyclic antidepressants, Ca channel blockers, progesterone, and nitrates.\\nComplications:\\n GERD may lead to esophagitis, peptic esophageal ulcer, esophageal stricture, Barrett's\\nesophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (see p. \\n186\\n). Factors that contribute to the development of\\nesophagitis include the caustic nature of the refluxate, the inability to clear the refluxate from the\\nesophagus, the volume of gastric contents, and local mucosal protective functions. Some patients,\\nparticularly infants, aspirate the reflux material.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe most prominent symptom of GERD is heartburn, with or without regurgitation of \\ngastric contents into\\nthe mouth. Infants present with vomiting, irritability, anorexia, and sometimes symptoms of chronic\\naspiration. Both adults and infants with chronic aspiration may have cough, hoarseness, or wheezing.\\nEsophagitis may cause odynophagia and even esophageal hemorrhage, which is usually occult but can\\nbe massive.

Gastritis and Peptic Ulcer Disease\\nIntroduction\\nAcid is secreted by parietal cells in the proximal two thirds (body) of the stomach. Gastric acid aids\\ndigestion by creating the optimal pH for pepsin and gastric lipase and by stimulating pancreatic\\nbicarbonate secretion. Acid secretion is initiated by food: the thought, smell, or taste of food effects vagal\\nstimulation of the gastrin-secreting G cells located in the distal one third (antrum) of the stomach. The\\narrival of protein to the stomach further stimulates gastrin output. Circulating gastrin triggers the release\\nof histamine from enterochromaffin-like cells in the body of the stomach. Histamine stimulates the parietal\\ncells via their H\\n2\\n receptors. The parietal cells secrete acid, and the resulting drop in pH causes the antral\\nD cells to release somatostatin, which inhibits gastrin release (negative feedback control).\\nAcid secretion is present at birth and reaches adult levels (on a weight basis) by age 2. There is a decline\\nin acid output in elderly patients who develop chronic gastritis, but acid output is otherwise maintained\\nthroughout life.\\nNormally, the GI mucosa is protected by several distinct mechanisms: (1) Mucosal production of mucus\\nand HCO\\n3\\n creates a pH gradient from the gastric lumen (low pH) to the mucosa (neutral pH). The mucus\\nserves as a barrier to the diffusion of acid and pepsin. (2) Epithelial cells remove excess hydrogen ions\\n(H\\n+\\n) via membrane transport systems and have tight junctions, which prevent back diffusion of H\\n+\\n ions.\\n(3) Mucosal blood flow removes excess acid that has diffused across the epithelial layer. Several growth\\nfactors (eg, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor I) and prostaglandins have been linked to\\nmucosal repair and maintenance of mucosal integrity.\\nFactors that interfere with these mucosal defenses (particularly NSAIDs and \\nHelicobacter pylori\\ninfection) predispose to gastritis and peptic ulcer disease.\\nNSAIDs promote mucosal inflammation and ulcer formation (sometimes with GI bleeding) both topically\\nand systemically. By inhibiting prostaglandin production via blockage \\nof the enzyme cyclooxygenase\\n(COX), NSAIDs reduce gastric blood flow, reduce mucus and HCO\\n3\\n secretion, and decrease cell repair\\nand replication. Also, because NSAIDs are weak acids and are nonionized at gastric pH, they diffuse\\nfreely across the mucus barrier into gastric epithelial cells, where H\\n+\\n ions are liberated, leading to cellular\\ndamage. Because gastric prostaglandin production involves the COX-1 isoform, NSAIDs that are selective\\nCOX-2 inhibitors have fewer adverse gastric effects than other NSAIDs.\\nHelicobacter pylori\\n Infection\\nH. pylori\\n is a common gastric pathogen that causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric\\nadenocarcinoma, and low-grade gastric lymphoma. Infection may be asymptomatic or result in\\nvarying degrees of dyspepsia. Diagnosis is by urea breath test and testing of endoscopic\\nbiopsy samples. Treatment is with a proton pump inhibitor plus two antibiotics.\\nH. pylori\\n is a spiral-shaped, gram-negative organism that has adapted to thrive in acid. In developing\\ncountries, it commonly causes chronic infections and is usually acquired during childhood. In the US,\\ninfection is less common among children but increases with age: by age 60, about 50% of people are\\ninfected. Infection is most common among blacks, Hispanics, and Asians.\\nThe organism has been cultured from stool, saliva, and dental plaque, which suggests oral-oral or fecal-\\noral transmission. Infections tend to cluster in families and in residents of custodial institutions.

Endoscopically, the mucosa may appear normal until\\natrophy is advanced, when submucosal vascularity may be visible. As atrophy becomes complete,\\nsecretion of acid and pepsin diminishes and intrinsic factor may be lost, resulting in vitamin B\\n12\\nmalabsorption.\\nMetaplasia:\\n Two types of metaplasia are common in chronic nonerosive gastritis: mucous gland and\\nintestinal.\\nMucous gland metaplasia (pseudopyloric metaplasia) occurs in the setting of severe atrophy of the\\ngastric glands, which are progressively replaced by mucous glands (antral mucosa), especially along the\\nlesser curve. Gastric ulcers may be present (typically at the junction of antral and corpus mucosa), but\\nwhether they are the cause or consequence of these metaplastic changes is not clear.\\nIntestinal metaplasia typically begins in the antrum in response to chronic mucosal injury and may extend\\nto the body. Gastric mucosa \\ncells change to resemble intestinal mucosa—with goblet cells, endocrine\\n(enterochromaffin or enterochromaffin-like) cells, and rudimentary villi—and may even assume functional\\n(absorptive) characteristics. Intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete (most common)\\nor incomplete. With complete metaplasia, gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel\\nmucosa, both histologically and functionally, with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides. In\\nincomplete metaplasia, the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large\\nintestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia.

For ulcers that continue to recur, the completeness of\\nvagotomy should be tested by gastric analysis, \\nH. pylori\\n eliminated if present, and Zollinger-Ellison\\nsyndrome ruled out by serum gastrin studies.\\nDrug Treatment of Gastric Acidity\\nDrugs for decreasing acidity are used for peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD—see p.\\n125\\n), and many forms of gastritis. Some drugs are used in regimens for treating \\nH. pylori\\n infection. Drugs\\ninclude proton pump inhibitors, H\\n2\\n blockers, antacids, and prostaglandins.\\nProton pump inhibitors:\\n These drugs are potent inhibitors of H\\n+\\n,K\\n+\\n-ATPase. This enzyme, located in\\nthe apical secretory membrane of the parietal cell, plays a key role in the secretion of H\\n+\\n (protons).\\nThese drugs can completely inhibit acid secretion and have a long duration of action. They promote ulcer\\nhealing and are also key components of \\nH. pylori\\n eradication regimens. Proton pump inhibitors have\\nreplaced H\\n2\\n blockers in most clinical situations because of greater rapidity of action and efficacy.\\nProton pump inhibitors include esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole, all available orally and IV,\\nand omeprazole and rabeprazole, available only orally in the US (see\\nTable 13-1\\n). Omeprazole is available without a prescription in the US. For uncomplicated duodenal ulcers,\\nomeprazole 20 mg po once/day or lansoprazole 30 mg po once/day is given for 4 wk. Complicated\\nduodenal ulcers (ie, multiple\\n[\\nTable 13-1.\\n Proton Pump Inhibitors]\\nulcers, bleeding ulcers, those > 1.5 cm, or those occurring in patients with serious underlying illness)\\nrespond better to higher doses (omeprazole 40 mg once/day, lansoprazole 60 mg once/day or 30 mg bid).\\nGastric ulcers require treatment for 6 to 8 wk. Gastritis and GERD require 8 to 12 wk of therapy; GERD\\nadditionally requires long-term maintenance.\\nLong-term proton pump inhibitor therapy produces elevated gastrin levels, which lead to\\nenterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia. However, there is no evidence of dysplasia or malignant\\ntransformation in patients receiving this treatment. Some may develop vitamin B\\n12\\n malabsorption.\\nH\\n2\\n blockers:\\n These drugs (cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, available IV and orally; and nizatidine\\navailable orally) are competitive inhibitors of histamine at the H\\n2\\n receptor, thus suppressing gastrin-\\nstimulated acid secretion and proportionately reducing gastric juice volume. Histamine-mediated pepsin\\nsecretion is also decreased.\\nH\\n2\\n blockers are well absorbed from the GI tract, with onset of action 30 to 60 min after ingestion and\\npeak effects at 1 to 2 h. IV administration produces a more rapid onset of action. Duration of action is\\nproportional to dose and ranges from 6 to 20 h. Doses should often be reduced in elderly patients.\\nFor duodenal ulcers, once daily oral administration of cimetidine 800 mg, ranitidine 300 mg, famotidine 40\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 13.

In addition, some antacids adsorb pepsin. Antacids may interfere with the absorption of\\nother drugs (eg, tetracycline, digoxin, iron).\\nAntacids relieve symptoms, promote ulcer healing, and reduce recurrence. They are relatively\\ninexpensive but must be taken 5 to 7 times/day. The optimal antacid regimen for ulcer healing seems to\\nbe 15 to 30 mL of liquid or 2 to 4 tablets 1 h and 3 h after each meal and at bedtime. The total daily\\ndosage of antacids should provide 200 to 400 mEq neutralizing capacity. However, antacids have been\\nsuperseded by \\nacid-suppressive therapy in the treatment of peptic ulcer and are used only for short-term\\nsymptom relief.\\nIn general, there are 2 types of antacids: absorbable and nonabsorbable. Absorbable antacids (eg, Na\\nbicarbonate, Ca carbonate) provide rapid, complete neutralization but may cause alkalosis and should be\\nused only briefly (1 or 2 days). Nonabsorbable antacids (eg, aluminum or Mg hydroxide) have fewer\\nsystemic adverse effects and are preferred.\\nAluminum hydroxide is a relatively safe, commonly used antacid. With chronic use, phosphate depletion\\noccasionally develops as a result of binding of phosphate by aluminum in the GI tract. The risk of\\nphosphate depletion increases in alcoholics, undernourished patients, and patients with renal disease\\n(including those receiving hemodialysis). Aluminum hydroxide causes constipation.\\nMg hydroxide is a more effective antacid than aluminum but may cause diarrhea. To limit diarrhea, many\\nproprietary antacids combine Mg and aluminum antacids. Because small amounts of Mg are absorbed,\\nMg preparations should be used with caution in patients with renal disease.\\nProstaglandins:\\n Certain prostaglandins (especially misoprostol) inhibit acid secretion by decreasing the\\ngeneration of cyclic AMP that is triggered by histamine stimulation of the parietal cell, and enhance\\nmucosal defense. Synthetic prostaglandin derivatives are used predominantly to decrease the risk of\\nNSAID-induced mucosal injury. Patients at high risk of NSAID-induced ulcers (ie, elderly patients, those\\nwith a history of ulcer or ulcer complication, those also taking corticosteroids) are candidates to take\\nmisoprostol 200 \\nμ\\ng po qid with food along with their NSAID. Common adverse effects of misoprostol are\\nabdominal cramping and diarrhea, which occur in 30% of patients. Misoprostol is a powerful abortifacient\\nand is absolutely contraindicated in women of childbearing age who are not using contraception.\\nSucralfate:\\n This drug is a sucrose-aluminum complex that dissociates in stomach acid and forms a\\nphysical barrier over an inflamed area, protecting it from acid, pepsin, and bile salts. It also inhibits\\npepsin-substrate interaction, stimulates mucosal prostaglandin production, and binds bile salts. It has no\\neffect on acid output or gastrin secretion. Sucralfate seems to have trophic effects on the ulcerated\\nmucosa, possibly by binding growth factors and concentrating them at an ulcer site. Systemic absorption\\nof sucralfate is negligible. Constipation occurs in 3 to 5% of patients. Sucralfate may bind to other drugs\\nand interfere with their absorption.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 13.

Bezoars and Foreign Bodies\\nIntroduction\\nFood and other ingested materials may collect and form solid masses within the GI tract.\\nBezoars\\nA bezoar is a tightly packed collection of partially digested or undigested material that is unable\\nto exit the stomach. It often occurs in patients with abnormal gastric emptying, especially those\\nthat have diabetic gastroparesis, as well as after gastric surgery. Many bezoars are\\nasymptomatic, but some cause symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Some can be dissolved\\nenzymatically, others removed endoscopically, and some require surgery.\\nPartially digested agglomerations of vegetable matter are called phytobezoars; agglomerations of hair are\\ncalled trichobezoars. Pharmacobezoars are concretions of medication (particularly common with\\nsucralfate and aluminum hydroxide gel). Many other substances have been found in bezoars.\\nEtiology\\nTrichobezoars, which can weigh several kg, most commonly occur in patients with psychiatric\\ndisturbances who chew and swallow their own hair. Phytobezoars often occur in patients who have\\nundergone a Billroth I or II partial gastrectomy, especially when accompanied by vagotomy.\\nHypochlorhydria, diminished antral motility, and incomplete mastication are the main predisposing factors;\\nthese factors are more common \\namong the elderly, who are thus at higher risk of bezoar formation.\\nOthers include diabetic gastroparesis and gastroplasty for morbid obesity. Consumption of persimmons (a\\nfruit containing the tannin shibuol, which polymerizes in the stomach) has been known to cause bezoars\\nthat require surgery in > 90% of cases. Persimmon bezoars often occur in epidemics in regions where the\\nfruit is grown.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost bezoars cause no symptoms, although postprandial fullness, nausea and vomiting, pain, and GI\\nbleeding may occur.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Endoscopy\\nBezoars are detectable as a mass lesion on most tests (eg, x-ray, ultrasound, CT) that may be done to\\nevaluate upper GI symptoms. They may be mistaken for tumors; upper endoscopy is usually done. On\\nendoscopy, bezoars have an unmistakable irregular surface and may range in color from yellow-green to\\ngray-black.

If enzymatic therapy is unsuccessful, or if patients are\\nsymptomatic, endoscopic removal may be tried. Rocklike concretions and trichobezoars usually require\\nlaparotomy.\\nForeign Bodies\\nA variety of foreign bodies may enter the GI tract. Many pass spontaneously, but some become\\nimpacted, causing symptoms of obstruction. Perforation may occur. The esophagus is the most\\ncommon (75%) site of impaction. Nearly all impacted objects can be removed endoscopically,\\nbut surgery is occasionally necessary.\\nUndigestible objects may be intentionally swallowed by children and demented adults. Denture wearers,\\nthe elderly, and inebriated people are prone to accidentally swallowing inadequately masticated food\\n(particularly meat), which may become impacted in the esophagus. Smugglers who swallow drug-filled\\nballoons, vials, or packages to escape detection (body packers or body stuffers) may develop intestinal\\nobstruction. The packaging may rupture, leading to drug overdose.\\nEsophageal foreign bodies:\\n Foreign bodies usually lodge in an area of esophageal narrowing such as\\nat the cricopharyngeus or aortic arch or just above the gastroesophageal junction.

However, objects larger than 5 × 2 cm \\nrarely pass\\nthe stomach. Sharp objects should be retrieved from the stomach because 15 to 35% will cause intestinal\\nperforation, but small round objects (eg, coins and button batteries) can simply be observed. The patient's\\nstools should be searched, and if the object does not appear, x-rays are taken at 48-h intervals. A coin\\nthat remains in the stomach for > 4 wk or a battery showing signs of corrosion on x-ray that remains in the\\nstomach for > 48 h should be removed. A hand-held metal detector can localize metallic foreign bodies\\nand provide information comparable to that yielded by plain x-rays.\\nPatients with symptoms of obstruction or perforation require laparotomy.

Pancreatitis\\nIntroduction\\nPancreatitis is classified as either acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis is inflammation that resolves both\\nclinically and histologically. Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by histologic changes that are\\nirreversible and progressive and that result in considerable loss of exocrine and endocrine pancreatic\\nfunction. Patients with chronic pancreatitis may have a flare-up of acute disease.\\nPancreatitis can affect both the exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas. Pancreatic acinar cells\\nsecrete bicarbonate and digestive enzymes into ducts that connect the pancreas to the duodenum at the\\nampulla of Vater (exocrine function). Pancreatic \\nβ\\n-cells secrete insulin directly into the bloodstream\\n(endocrine function).\\nAcute Pancreatitis\\nAcute pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas (and, sometimes, adjacent tissues) caused\\nby the release of activated pancreatic enzymes. The most common triggers are biliary tract\\ndisease and chronic heavy alcohol intake. The condition ranges from mild (abdominal pain and\\nvomiting) to severe (pancreatic necrosis and a systemic inflammatory process with shock and\\nmultiorgan failure). Diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and serum amylase and lipase\\nlevels. Treatment is supportive, with IV fluids, analgesics, and fasting.\\nEtiology\\nBiliary tract disease and alcoholism account for ≥ 80% of acute pancreatitis cases. The remaining 20%\\nresult from myriad causes (see\\nTable 15-1\\n).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe precise mechanism by which obstruction of the sphincter of Oddi by a gallstone or microlithiasis\\n(sludge) causes pancreatitis is unclear, although it probably involves increased ductal pressure.\\nProlonged alcohol intake (> 100 g/day for > 3 to 5 yr) may cause the protein of pancreatic enzymes to\\nprecipitate within small pancreatic ductules. Ductal obstruction by these protein plugs may cause\\npremature activation of pancreatic enzymes. An alcohol binge in such patients can trigger pancreatitis, but\\nthe exact mechanism is not known.\\nA number of genetic mutations predisposing to pancreatitis have been identified. One, an autosomal\\ndominant mutation of the cationic trypsinogen gene, causes pancreatitis in 80% of carriers; an obvious\\nfamilial pattern is present. Other mutations have lesser penetrance and are not readily apparent clinically\\nexcept through genetic testing. The genetic abnormality responsible for cystic fibrosis increases the risk\\nof recurrent acute as well as chronic pancreatitis.\\nRegardless of the etiology, pancreatic enzymes (including trypsin, phospholipase A\\n2\\n, and elastase)\\nbecome activated within the gland itself. The enzymes can damage tissue and activate complement and\\nthe inflammatory cascade, producing cytokines. This process causes inflammation, edema, and\\nsometimes necrosis. In mild pancreatitis, inflammation is confined to the pancreas; the mortality rate is <\\n5%. In severe pancreatitis, there is significant inflammation, with necrosis and hemorrhage of the gland\\nand a systemic inflammatory response; the mortality rate is 10 to 50%. After 5 to 7 days, necrotic\\npancreatic tissue may become infected by enteric bacteria.\\n[\\nTable 15-1.\\n Some Causes of Acute Pancreatitis]\\nActivated enzymes and cytokines that enter the peritoneal cavity cause a chemical burn and third spacing\\nof fluid; those that enter the systemic circulation cause a systemic inflammatory response that can result\\nin acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure.

However, the level of p-type also increases in\\nrenal failure and in other severe abdominal conditions in which amylase clearance is altered.\\nThe WBC count usually increases to 12,000 to 20,000/\\nμ\\nL. Third-space fluid losses may increase the Hct\\nto as high as 50 to 55%, indicating severe inflammation. Hyperglycemia may occur. Serum Ca\\nconcentration falls as early as the first day because of the formation of Ca \"soaps\" secondary to excess\\ngeneration of free fatty acids, especially by pancreatic lipase. Serum bilirubin increases in 15 to 25% of\\npatients because pancreatic edema compresses the common bile duct.\\nImaging:\\n Plain x-rays of the abdomen may disclose calcifications within pancreatic ducts (evidence of\\nprior inflammation and hence chronic pancreatitis), calcified gallstones, or localized ileus in the left upper\\nquadrant or the center of the abdomen (a \"sentinel loop\" of small bowel, dilation of the transverse colon,\\nor duodenal ileus). Chest x-ray may reveal atelectasis or a pleural effusion (usually left-sided or bilateral\\nbut rarely confined to the right pleural space).\\nUltrasound should be done if gallstone pancreatitis is suspected (and another etiology is not obvious) to\\ndetect gallstones or dilation of the common bile duct (which indicates biliary tract obstruction). Edema of\\nthe pancreas may be visualized, but overlying gas frequently obscures the pancreas.\\nCT with IV contrast is generally done to identify necrosis, fluid collections, or pseudocysts once\\npancreatitis has been diagnosed. It is particularly recommended for severe pancreatitis or if a\\ncomplication ensues (eg, hypotension or progressive leukocytosis and elevation of temperature). IV\\ncontrast facilitates the recognition of pancreatic necrosis; however, it may cause pancreatic necrosis in\\nareas of low perfusion (ie, ischemia). Thus, contrast-enhanced CT should be done only after the patient\\nhas been adequately hydrated.\\nIf pancreatic infection is suspected, fluid obtained by percutaneous CT-guided needle aspiration of cysts\\nor areas of fluid collection or necrosis may reveal organisms on Gram stain or culture. The diagnosis is\\nsupported by positive blood cultures and, particularly, by the presence of air bubbles in the\\nretroperitoneum on abdominal CT. The advent of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography\\n(MRCP) may make the selection of pancreatic imaging simpler.\\nPrognosis\\nIn edematous pancreatitis, mortality is < 5%. In pancreatitis with necrosis and hemorrhage, mortality is 10\\nto 50%. In pancreatic infection, mortality is usually 100% without extensive surgical debridement or\\ndrainage of the infected area.\\nCT findings correlate with prognosis. If CT is normal or shows only mild pancreatic edema (Balthazar\\nclass A or B), the prognosis is excellent. Patients with peripancreatic inflammation or one area of fluid\\ncollection (classes C and D) have a 10 to 15% incidence of abscess formation; the incidence is over 60%\\nin patients with two or more areas of fluid collection (class E).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 15.

Gastroenteritis\\nIntroduction\\n(See also \\nFood Allergy\\n on p. \\n1118\\n and \\nMushroom Poisoning\\n on p. \\n3336\\n.)\\nGastroenteritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach and small and large intestines. Most\\ncases are infectious, although gastroenteritis may occur after ingestion of drugs and chemical\\ntoxins (eg, metals, plant substances). Symptoms include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,\\nand abdominal discomfort. Diagnosis is clinical or by stool culture, although immunoassays are\\nincreasingly used. Treatment is symptomatic, although parasitic and some bacterial infections\\nrequire specific anti-infective therapy.\\nGastroenteritis is usually uncomfortable but self-limited. Electrolyte and fluid loss is usually little more than\\nan inconvenience to an otherwise healthy adult but can be grave for people who are very young (see p.\\n2806\\n), elderly, or debilitated or who have serious concomitant illnesses. Worldwide, an estimated 3 to 6\\nmillion children die each year from infectious gastroenteritis.\\nEtiology\\nInfectious gastroenteritis may be caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites. Many specific organisms are\\ndiscussed further in the Infectious Diseases section.\\nViruses:\\n The viruses most commonly implicated are\\n• Rotavirus\\n• Norovirus\\nViruses are the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the US. They infect enterocytes in the villous\\nepithelium of the small bowel. The result is transudation of fluid and salts into the intestinal lumen;\\nsometimes, malabsorption of carbohydrates worsens symptoms by causing osmotic diarrhea. Diarrhea is\\nwatery. Inflammatory diarrhea (dysentery), with fecal WBCs and RBCs or gross blood, is uncommon. Four\\ncategories of viruses cause most gastroenteritis: rotavirus and calicivirus (predominantly the norovirus\\n[formerly Norwalk virus]) cause the majority of viral gastroenteritis, followed by astrovirus and enteric\\nadenovirus.\\nRotavirus is the most common cause of sporadic, severe, dehydrating diarrhea in young children (peak\\nincidence, 3 to 15 mo). Rotavirus is highly contagious; most infections occur by the fecal-oral route. Adults\\nmay be infected after close contact with an infected infant. The illness in adults is generally mild.\\nIncubation is 1 to 3 days. In temperate climates, most infections occur in the winter. Each year in the US,\\na wave of rotavirus illness begins in the Southwest in November and ends in the Northeast in March.\\nNorovirus most commonly infects older children and adults. Infections occur year-round. Norovirus is the\\nprincipal cause of sporadic viral gastroenteritis in adults and of epidemic viral gastroenteritis in all age\\ngroups; large waterborne and food-borne outbreaks occur. Person-to-person transmission also occurs\\nbecause the virus is highly contagious. Incubation is 24 to 48 h.\\nAstrovirus can infect people of all ages but usually infects infants and young children. Infection is most\\ncommon in winter. Transmission is by the fecal-oral route. Incubation is 3 to 4 days.\\nAdenoviruses are the 4th most common cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis. Infections occur year-\\nround, with a slight increase in summer. Children < 2 yr are primarily affected. Transmission is by the\\nfecal-oral route. Incubation is 3 to 10 days.\\nIn immunocompromised patients, additional viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus, enterovirus) can cause\\ngastroenteritis.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 16.

These toxins impair intestinal absorption and cause secretion\\nof electrolytes and water by stimulating adenylate cyclase, resulting in watery diarrhea. \\nClostridium\\ndifficile\\n produces a similar toxin when overgrowth follows antibiotic use (see p. \\n1292\\n).\\nSome bacteria (eg, \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n, \\nBacillus cereus\\n, \\nClostridium perfringens\\n) produce an\\nexotoxin that is ingested in contaminated food. The exotoxin can cause gastroenteritis without bacterial\\ninfection. These toxins generally cause acute nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within 12 h of ingestion of\\ncontaminated food. Symptoms abate within 36 h.\\nOther bacteria (eg, \\nShigella\\n, \\nSalmonella\\n, \\nCampylobacter\\n, some \\nE. coli\\n subtypes) invade the mucosa of\\nthe small bowel or colon and cause microscopic ulceration, bleeding, exudation of protein-rich fluid, and\\nsecretion of electrolytes and water. The invasive process and its results can occur whether or not the\\norganism produces an enterotoxin. The resulting diarrhea contains WBCs and RBCs and sometimes\\ngross blood.\\nSalmonella\\n and \\nCampylobacter\\n are the most common bacterial causes of diarrheal illness in the US.\\nBoth infections are most frequently acquired through undercooked poultry; unpasteurized milk is also a\\npossible source. \\nCampylobacter\\n is occasionally transmitted from dogs or cats with diarrhea. \\nSalmonella\\ncan be transmitted by undercooked eggs and by contact with reptiles. Species of \\nShigella\\n are the 3rd\\nmost common bacterial cause of diarrhea in the US and are usually transmitted person to person,\\nalthough food-borne epidemics occur. \\nShigella dysenteriae\\n type 1 (not present in the US) produces\\nShiga toxin, which can cause hemolytic-uremic syndrome (see p. \\n961\\n).\\nSeveral different subtypes of \\nE. coli\\n cause diarrhea. The epidemiology and clinical manifestations vary\\ngreatly depending on the subtype: (1) Enterohemorrhagic \\nE. coli\\n is the most clinically significant subtype\\nin the US. It produces Shiga toxin, which causes bloody diarrhea (hemorrhagic colitis). \\nE. coli\\n O157:H7 is\\nthe most common strain of this subtype in the US. Undercooked ground beef, unpasteurized milk and\\njuice, and contaminated water are possible sources. Person-to-person transmission is common in the day\\ncare setting. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is a serious complication that develops in 2 to 7% of cases,\\nmost commonly among the young and old. (2) Enterotoxigenic \\nE. coli\\n produces two toxins (one similar to\\ncholera toxin) that cause watery diarrhea. This subtype is the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea.\\n(3) Enteropathogenic \\nE. coli\\n causes watery diarrhea. Once a common cause of diarrhea outbreaks in\\nnurseries, this subtype is now rare. (4) Enteroinvasive \\nE. coli\\n causes bloody or nonbloody diarrhea,\\nprimarily in the developing world.

Malabsorption Syndromes\\nIntroduction\\nMalabsorption is inadequate assimilation of dietary substances due to defects in digestion, absorption, or\\ntransport. Malabsorption can affect macronutrients (eg, proteins, carbohydrates, fats), micronutrients (eg,\\nvitamins, minerals), or both, causing excessive fecal excretion, nutritional deficiencies, and GI symptoms.\\nPathophysiology\\nDigestion and absorption occur in three phases: (1) intraluminal hydrolysis of fats, proteins, and\\ncarbohydrates by enzymes—bile salts enhance the solubilization of fat in this phase; (2) digestion by\\nbrush border enzymes and uptake of end-products; and (3) lymphatic transport of nutrients.\\nMalabsorption occurs when any of these phases is impaired.\\nFats:\\n Pancreatic enzymes split long-chain triglycerides into fatty acids and monoglycerides, which\\ncombine with bile acids and phospholipids to form micelles that pass through jejunal enterocytes.\\nAbsorbed fatty acids are resynthesized and combined with protein, cholesterol, and phospholipid to form\\nchylomicrons, which are transported by the lymphatic system. Medium-chain triglycerides are absorbed\\ndirectly.\\nUnabsorbed fats trap fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and possibly some minerals, causing deficiency.\\nBacterial overgrowth results in deconjugation and dehydroxylation of bile salts, limiting the absorption of\\nfats. Unabsorbed bile salts stimulate the colon, causing diarrhea.\\nCarbohydrates:\\n Enzymes on microvilli lyse carbohydrates and disaccharides into constituent\\nmonosaccharides. Colonic bacteria ferment unabsorbed carbohydrates into CO\\n2\\n, methane, H\\n2\\n, and\\nshort-chain fatty acids (butyrate, propionate, acetate, and lactate). These fatty acids cause diarrhea. The\\ngases cause abdominal distention and bloating.\\nProteins:\\n Enterokinase, a brush border enzyme, activates trypsinogen into trypsin, which converts many\\npancreatic proteases into their active forms. Active pancreatic enzymes hydrolyze proteins into\\noligopeptides, which are absorbed directly or hydrolyzed into amino acids.\\nEtiology\\nMalabsorption has many causes (see\\nTable 17-1\\n). Some malabsorptive disorders (eg, celiac sprue) impair the absorption of most nutrients,\\nvitamins, and trace minerals (global malabsorption); others (eg, pernicious anemia) are more selective.\\n[\\nTable 17-1.\\n Causes of Malabsorption]\\nPancreatic insufficiency causes malabsorption if > 90% of function is lost. Increased luminal acidity (eg,\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome) inhibits lipase and fat digestion. Cirrhosis and cholestasis reduce hepatic bile\\nsynthesis or delivery of bile salts to the duodenum, causing malabsorption. Other causes are discussed\\nelsewhere in this chapter.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe effects of unabsorbed substances include diarrhea, steatorrhea, abdominal bloating, and gas. Other\\nsymptoms result from nutritional deficiencies. Patients often lose weight despite adequate food intake.\\nChronic diarrhea is the most common symptom and is what usually prompts evaluation of the patient.\\nSteatorrhea—fatty stool, the hallmark of malabsorption—occurs when > 7 g/day of fat are excreted.\\nSteatorrhea causes foul-smelling, pale, bulky, and greasy stools.\\nSevere vitamin and mineral deficiencies occur in advanced malabsorption; symptoms are related to the\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 17.

The etiology is\\nsometimes obvious. For example, those with malabsorption due to chronic pancreatitis usually have had\\nprior bouts of acute pancreatitis. Patients with celiac sprue can present with classic lifelong diarrhea\\nexacerbated by gluten products and may have dermatitis herpetiformis. Those with cirrhosis and\\npancreatic cancer can present with jaundice. Abdominal distention, excessive flatus, and watery diarrhea\\noccurring 30 to 90 min after carbohydrate ingestion suggest deficiency of a disaccharidase enzyme,\\nusually lactase. Previous extensive abdominal operations suggest short bowel syndrome.\\nIf the history suggests a specific cause, testing should be directed to that condition (see\\nFig. 17-1\\n). If no cause is readily apparent, blood tests can be used as screening tools (eg, CBC, RBC\\nindices, ferritin, vitamin B\\n12\\n, folate, Ca, albumin, cholesterol, PT). These results may suggest a diagnosis\\nand direct further investigation.\\n[\\nTable 17-2.\\n Symptoms of Malabsorption]\\nMacrocytic anemia should prompt measurement of serum folate and B\\n12\\n levels. Folate deficiency is\\ncommon in mucosal disorders involving the proximal small bowel (eg, celiac sprue, tropical sprue,\\nWhipple's disease). Low B\\n12\\n levels can occur in pernicious anemia, chronic pancreatitis, bacterial\\novergrowth, and terminal ileal disease. A combination of low B\\n12\\n and high folate levels is suggestive of\\nbacterial overgrowth, because intestinal bacteria use vitamin B\\n12\\n and synthesize folate.\\nMicrocytic anemia suggests iron deficiency, which may occur with celiac sprue. Albumin is a general\\nindicator of nutritional state. Low albumin can result from poor intake, decreased synthesis in cirrhosis, or\\nprotein wasting. Low serum carotene (a precursor of vitamin A) suggests malabsorption if intake is\\nadequate.\\nConfirming malabsorption:\\n Tests to confirm malabsorption are appropriate when symptoms are vague\\nand the etiology is not apparent. Most tests for malabsorption assess fat malabsorption because it is\\nrelatively easy to measure. Confirmation of carbohydrate malabsorption is not helpful once steatorrhea is\\ndocumented. Tests for protein malabsorption are rarely used because fecal nitrogen is difficult to\\nmeasure.\\n[\\nFig. 17-1.\\n Suggested evaluation for malabsorption.]\\n[\\nTable 17-3.\\n Small-Bowel Mucosal Histology in Certain Malabsorptive Disorders]\\nDirect measurement of fecal fat from a 72-h stool collection is the gold standard for establishing\\nsteatorrhea but unnecessary with gross steatorrhea of obvious cause.

A\\nnormal D-xylose test in the presence of moderate to severe steatorrhea indicates pancreatic exocrine\\ninsufficiency rather than small-bowel mucosal disease.

Urine is collected over 5\\nh, and a venous sample is obtained after 1 h. Serum D-xylose < 20 mg/dL or < 4 g in the urine sample\\nindicates abnormal absorption. Falsely low levels can also occur in renal diseases, portal hypertension,\\nascites, or delayed gastric emptying time. This test is rarely used today.

Aspirate from the small bowel can be\\nsent for bacterial culture and colony count to document bacterial overgrowth. Histologic features on small-\\nbowel biopsy (see \\nTable 17-3\\n) can establish the specific mucosal disease.\\nSmall-bowel x-rays (eg, small-bowel follow-through, enteroclysis) can detect anatomic conditions that\\npredispose to bacterial overgrowth. These include jejunal diverticula, fistulas, surgically created blind\\nloops and anastomoses, ulcerations, and strictures. Abdominal flat plate x-ray may show pancreatic\\ncalcifications indicative of chronic pancreatitis. Barium contrast studies of the small bowel are neither\\nsensitive nor specific but may have findings suggestive of mucosal disease (eg, dilated small-bowel\\nloops, thinned or thickened mucosal folds, coarse fragmentation of the barium column).\\nTests for pancreatic insufficiency (eg, secretin stimulation test, bentiromide test, pancreolauryl test, serum\\ntrypsinogen, fecal elastase, fecal chymotrypsin—see p. \\n145\\n) are done if history is suggestive but are not\\nsensitive for mild pancreatic disease.\\nThe \\n14\\nC-xylose breath test helps diagnose bacterial overgrowth. \\n14\\nC-xylose is given orally, and the\\nexhaled \\n14\\nCO\\n2\\n concentration is measured.

Intestinal motility disorders\\nassociated with diabetic neuropathy, systemic sclerosis, amyloidosis, and idiopathic intestinal pseudo-\\nobstruction can also impair bacterial clearance. Achlorhydria and idiopathic changes in intestinal motility\\nmay cause bacterial overgrowth in elderly people.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe excess bacteria consume nutrients, including vitamin B\\n12\\n and carbohydrates, leading to caloric\\ndeprivation and vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency. However, because the bacteria produce folate, this deficiency is\\nrare. The bacteria deconjugate bile salts, causing failure of micelle formation and subsequent fat\\nmalabsorption. Severe bacterial overgrowth also damages the intestinal mucosa. Fat malabsorption and\\nmucosal damage can cause diarrhea.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMany patients are asymptomatic and present with only weight loss or nutrient deficiencies. \\nSome have\\nsignificant diarrhea or steatorrhea.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 17.

Undigested\\ndisaccharides cause an osmotic load that attracts water and electrolytes into the bowel, causing watery\\ndiarrhea.

Congenital deficiencies are\\nrare.\\nAcquired lactase deficiency (primary adult hypolactasia) is the most common form of carbohydrate\\nintolerance. Lactase levels are high in neonates, permitting digestion of milk; in most ethnic groups (80%\\nof blacks and Hispanics, almost 100% of Asians), the levels decrease in the post-weaning period\\nrendering older children and adults unable to digest significant amounts of lactose.

In infants, temporary secondary disaccharidase deficiency may\\ncomplicate enteric infections or abdominal surgery. Recovery from the underlying disease is followed by\\nan increase in activity of the enzyme.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms and signs are similar in all disaccharidase deficiencies. A child who cannot tolerate lactose\\ndevelops diarrhea after ingesting significant amounts of milk and may not gain weight. An affected adult\\nmay have watery diarrhea, bloating, excessive flatus, nausea, borborygmi, and abdominal cramps after\\ningesting lactose. The patient often recognizes this early in life and avoids eating dairy products.\\nSymptoms typically require ingestion of more than the equivalent of 8 to 12 oz of milk. Diarrhea may be\\nsevere enough to purge other nutrients before they can be absorbed. Symptoms may be similar to and\\ncan be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (see p. \\n162\\n).\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical diagnosis\\n• H\\n2\\n breath test for confirmation\\nLactose intolerance can usually be diagnosed with a careful history supported by \\ndietary challenge.\\nPatients usually have a history of intolerance to milk and dairy foods. The diagnosis is also suggested if\\nthe stool from chronic or intermittent diarrhea is acidic (pH < 6) and can be confirmed by an H\\n2\\n breath or\\na lactose tolerance test.\\nIn the H\\n2\\n breath test, 50 g of lactose is given orally and the H\\n2\\n produced by bacterial metabolism of\\nundigested lactose is measured with a breath meter at 2, 3, and 4 h postingestion. Most affected patients\\nhave an increase in expired H\\n2\\n of > 20 ppm over baseline. Sensitivity and specificity are > 95%.\\nThe lactose tolerance test is less specific. Oral lactose (1.0 to 1.5 g/kg body weight) is given. Serum\\nglucose is measured before ingestion and 60 and 120 min after. Lactose-intolerant patients develop\\ndiarrhea, abdominal bloating, and discomfort within 20 to 30 min, and their serum glucose levels do not\\nrise > 20 mg/dL (< 1.1 mmol/L) above baseline. Low lactase activity in a jejunal biopsy specimen is\\ndiagnostic, but endoscopy is needed to obtain a specimen and is not routine.\\nTreatment\\n• Dietary restriction\\nCarbohydrate malabsorption is readily controlled by avoiding dietary sugars that cannot be absorbed (ie,\\nfollowing a lactose-free diet in cases of lactase deficiency). However, because the degree of lactose\\nmalabsorption varies greatly, many patients can ingest up to 12 oz (18 g of lactose) of milk daily without\\nsymptoms. Yogurt is usually tolerated because it contains an appreciable amount of lactase produced by\\nintrinsic \\nLactobacilli\\n.\\nFor symptomatic patients wishing to drink milk, lactose in milk can be predigested by the addition of a\\ncommercially prepared lactase, and pretreated milk is now available.

The inflammatory\\nresponse causes characteristic mucosal villous atrophy in the small bowel.\\nEpidemiology:\\n Celiac sprue mainly affects whites of northern European descent. Prevalence estimates\\nbased on serologic screens (sometimes confirmed by biopsy) indicate the disorder is present in about\\n1/300 in Europe and perhaps 1/250 in the US overall (but there may be significant variation among\\nregions in the US).\\nThe disease affects about 10 to 20% of 1st-degree relatives. Female:male ratio is 2:1. Onset is generally\\nin childhood but may occur later.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe clinical presentation varies; no typical presentation exists. Some patients are asymptomatic or have\\nonly signs of nutritional deficiency. Others have significant GI symptoms.\\nCeliac sprue can manifest in infancy and childhood after introduction of cereals into the diet. The child\\nhas failure to thrive, apathy, anorexia, pallor, generalized hypotonia, abdominal distention, and muscle\\nwasting. Stools are soft, bulky, clay-colored, and offensive. Older children may present with anemia or\\nfailure to grow normally.\\nIn adults, lassitude, weakness, and anorexia are most common. Mild and intermittent diarrhea is\\nsometimes the presenting symptom. Steatorrhea ranges from mild to severe (7 to 50 g fat/day). Some\\npatients have weight loss, rarely enough to become underweight. Anemia, glossitis, angular stomatitis,\\nand aphthous ulcers are usually seen in these patients. Manifestations of vitamin D and Ca deficiencies\\n(eg, osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis) are common. Both men and women may have reduced\\nfertility.\\nAbout 10% have dermatitis herpetiformis, an intensely pruritic papulovesicular rash that is symmetrically\\ndistributed over the extensor areas of the elbows, knees, buttocks, shoulders, and scalp. This rash can\\nbe induced by a high-gluten diet. Celiac sprue is also associated with diabetes mellitus, autoimmune\\nthyroid disease, and Down syndrome.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Serologic markers\\n• Small-bowel biopsy\\nThe diagnosis is suspected clinically and by laboratory abnormalities suggestive of malabsorption.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome\\n(Spastic Colon)\\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is characterized by abdominal discomfort or pain that is\\naccompanied by at least two of the following: relief by defecation, change in frequency of stool,\\nor change in consistency of stool. The cause is unknown, and the pathophysiology is\\nincompletely understood. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is symptomatic, consisting of dietary\\nmanagement and drugs, including anticholinergics and agents active at serotonin receptors.\\nEtiology\\nThe cause of IBS is unknown. No anatomic cause can be found on laboratory tests, x-rays, and biopsies.\\nEmotional factors, diet, drugs, or hormones may precipitate or aggravate GI symptoms. Historically, the\\ndisorder was often considered as purely psychosomatic. Although psychosocial factors are involved, IBS\\nis better understood as a combination of psychosocial and physiologic factors.\\nPsychosocial factors:\\n Psychologic distress is common among patients with IBS, especially among\\nthose who seek medical care. Some patients have anxiety disorders, depression, or a somatization\\ndisorder. Sleep disturbances also \\ncoexist. However, stress and emotional conflict do not always coincide\\nwith symptom onset and recurrence. Some patients with IBS seem to have a learned aberrant illness\\nbehavior (ie, they express emotional conflict as a GI complaint, usually abdominal pain). The physician\\nevaluating patients with IBS, particularly those with refractory symptoms, should investigate for\\nunresolved psychologic issues, including the possibility of sexual or physical abuse. Psychosocial factors\\nalso affect the outcome in IBS.\\nPhysiologic factors:\\n A variety of physiologic factors seem to be involved in IBS symptoms. Factors\\ninclude altered motility, visceral hyperalgesia, and various genetic and environmental factors.\\nVisceral hyperalgesia refers to hypersensitivity to normal amounts of intraluminal distention and\\nheightened perception of pain in the presence of normal quantities of intestinal gas; it may result from\\nremodeling of neural pathways in the brain-gut axis. Some patients (perhaps 1 in 7) have reported their\\nIBS symptoms began after an episode of acute gastroenteritis (termed postinfectious IBS). A subset of\\npatients with IBS has autonomic dysfunctions. However, many patients have no demonstrable physiologic\\nabnormalities, and even in those that do, the abnormalities may not correlate with symptoms.\\nConstipation may be explained by slower colonic transit, and diarrhea may be explained by faster colonic\\ntransit. Some patients with constipation have fewer colonic high amplitude-propagated contractions,\\nwhich propel colonic contents over several segments. Conversely, excess sigmoid motor activity may\\nretard transit in functional constipation.\\nPostprandial abdominal discomfort may be attributed to an exaggerated gastro-colonic reflex (the colonic\\ncontractile response to a meal), the presence of colonic high amplitude-propagated contractions,\\nincreased intestinal sensitivity (visceral hyperalgesia), or a combination of these. Fat ingestion may\\nexaggerate hypersensitivity.\\nHormonal fluctuations affect bowel functions in women. Rectal sensitivity is increased during menses but\\nnot during other phases of the menstrual cycle. The effects of sex steroids on GI transit are subtle. The\\nrole of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth in IBS is controversial.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nIBS tends to begin in the teens and 20s, causing bouts of symptoms that recur at irregular periods. Onset\\nin late adult life is less common but not rare. Symptoms rarely rouse the sleeping patient. Symptoms are\\noften triggered by food, particularly fats, or by stress.\\nPatients have abdominal discomfort, which varies considerably but is often located in the lower quadrant,\\nsteady or cramping in nature, and relieved by defecation.

Pain or discomfort related\\nto defecation is likely to be of bowel origin; that associated with exercise, movement, urination, or\\nmenstruation usually has a different cause. Although bowel patterns are relatively consistent in most\\npatients, it is not unusual for patients to alternate between constipation and diarrhea. Patients may also\\nhave symptoms of abnormal stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete evacuation), pass\\nmucus, or complain of bloating or abdominal distention. Many patients also have symptoms of dyspepsia.\\nExtraintestinal symptoms (eg, fatigue, fibromyalgia, sleep disturbances, chronic headaches) are common.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation, based on Rome criteria\\n• Screening for organic causes with basic laboratory tests and sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy\\n• Other tests for patients with red flag findings (rectal blood, weight loss, fever)\\nDiagnosis is based on characteristic bowel patterns, time and character of pain, and exclusion of other\\ndisease processes through physical examination and routine diagnostic tests. Diagnostic testing should\\nbe more intensive when the following red flag findings are present either at initial presentation or at any\\ntime after diagnosis: older age, fever, weight loss, rectal bleeding, vomiting. Because patients with IBS\\ncan develop organic conditions, testing for other conditions should also be considered in patients who\\ndevelop alarm symptoms or markedly different symptoms during the course of IBS. Common illnesses that\\nmay be confused with IBS include lactose intolerance, drug-induced diarrhea, post-cholecystectomy\\ndiarrhea, laxative abuse, parasitic diseases (eg, giardiasis), eosinophilic gastritis or enteritis, microscopic\\ncolitis, and early inflammatory bowel disease. However, uninflamed colonic diverticula do not cause\\nsymptoms, and their presence should not be considered explanatory.\\nThe bimodal age distribution of patients with inflammatory bowel disease makes it imperative to evaluate\\nboth younger and older \\npatients. In patients > 60 with acute symptoms, ischemic colitis should be\\nconsidered. Patients with constipation and no anatomic lesion should be evaluated for hypothyroidism\\nand hyperparathyroidism. If the patient's symptoms suggest malabsorption, tropical sprue, celiac disease,\\nand Whipple's disease must be considered. Defecatory disorders should be considered as a cause of\\nconstipation in patients who report symptoms of difficult defecation. Rare causes of diarrhea include\\nhyperthyroidism, medullary cancer of the thyroid, or carcinoid syndrome, gastrinoma, vipoma, and\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, secretory diarrhea caused by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),\\ncalcitonin, or gastrin is typically accompanied by stool volumes > 1000 mL daily.\\nHistory:\\n Particular attention should be given to the character of the pain, bowel habits, familial\\ninterrelationships, and drug and dietary histories. Equally important are the patient's overall emotional\\nstate, interpretation of personal problems and quality of life. The quality of the patient-physician\\ninteraction is key to diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy.\\nThe \\nRome criteria\\n are standardized symptom-based criteria for diagnosing IBS. The Rome criteria\\nrequire the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days/mo in the last 3 mo along with ≥ 2\\nof the following: (1) improvement with defecation, (2) onset (of each episode of discomfort) associated\\nwith a change in frequency of defecation, or (3) change in consistency of stool.\\nPhysical examination:\\n Patients generally appear to be healthy. Palpation of the abdomen may reveal\\ntenderness, particularly in the left lower quadrant, at times associated with a palpable, tender sigmoid. A\\ndigital rectal examination, including a test for occult blood, should be done on all patients. In women, a\\npelvic examination helps rule out ovarian tumors and cysts or endometriosis, which may mimic IBS.\\nTesting:\\n The diagnosis of IBS can reasonably be made using the Rome criteria as long as patients have\\nno red flag findings, such as rectal bleeding, weight loss, and fever, or other findings that might suggest\\nanother etiology.

An effective therapeutic relationship is essential for effectively\\nmanaging IBS. Patients should be invited to express not only their symptoms but also their understanding\\nof their symptoms and the reasons prompting a visit to the health care practitioner (eg, fear of serious\\ndisease). Patients should be educated about the disorder (eg, normal bowel physiology and the bowel's\\nhypersensitivity to stress and food) and reassured, after appropriate tests, about the absence of a serious\\nor life-threatening \\ndisease. Appropriate therapeutic goals (eg, expectations regarding the normal course\\nor variability in symptoms, adverse effects of drugs, the appropriate and available working relationship\\nbetween the physician and the patient) should be established. Finally, patients can benefit by being\\nactively involved in the management of their condition. When successful, this can enhance the patient's\\nmotivation to adhere to treatment, foster a more positive physician-patient relationship, and mobilize the\\ncoping resources of even the most chronically passive patients. Psychologic stress, anxiety, or mood\\ndisorders should be identified, evaluated, and treated. Regular physical activity helps relieve stress and\\nassists in bowel function, particularly in patients with constipation.\\nDiet:\\n In general, a normal diet should be followed. Meals should not be overly large, and eating should be\\nslow and paced. Patients with abdominal distention and increased flatulence may benefit from reducing or\\neliminating beans, cabbage, and other foods containing fermentable carbohydrates. Reduced intake of\\nsweeteners (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, fructose), which are constituents of natural and processed foods (eg,\\napple and grape juice, bananas, nuts, and raisins), may alleviate flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea.\\nPatients with evidence of lactose intolerance should reduce their intake of milk and dairy products. A low-\\nfat diet may reduce postprandial abdominal symptoms.\\nDietary fiber supplements may soften stool and improve the ease of evacuation.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease\\nIntroduction\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), is a\\nrelapsing and remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation at various sites in the GI tract,\\nwhich results in diarrhea and abdominal pain.\\nInflammation results from a cell-mediated immune response in the GI mucosa. The precise etiology is\\nunknown, but evidence suggests that the normal intestinal flora trigger an immune reaction in patients\\nwith a multifactorial genetic predisposition (perhaps involving abnormal epithelial barriers and mucosal\\nimmune defenses). No specific environmental, dietary, or infectious causes have been identified. The\\nimmune reaction involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, interleukins, and\\ntumor necrosis factor (TNF).\\nAlthough Crohn's disease and UC are similar, they can be distinguished in most cases (see\\nTable 19-1\\n). About 10% of colitis cases are considered indeterminate. The term colitis applies only to\\ninflammatory disease of the colon (eg, ulcerative, granulomatous, ischemic, radiation-induced, infectious).\\nSpastic (mucous) colitis is a misnomer sometimes applied to a functional disorder, irritable bowel\\nsyndrome (see p. \\n162\\n).\\nEpidemiology:\\n IBD affects people of all ages but usually begins before age 30, with peak incidence from\\n14 to 24. IBD may have a second smaller peak between ages 50 and 70; however, this later peak may\\ninclude some cases of ischemic colitis.\\nIBD is most common among people of Northern European and Anglo-Saxon origin and is 2 to 4 times\\nmore common among Ashkenazi Jews than in non-Jewish whites. The incidence is lower in central and\\nsouthern Europe and lower still in South America, Asia, and Africa. However, the incidence is increasing\\namong blacks and Latin Americans living in North America. Both sexes are equally affected. First-degree\\nrelatives of patients with IBD have a 4- to 20-fold increased risk; their absolute risk may be as high as\\n7%. Familial tendency is much higher in Crohn's disease than in UC.\\n[\\nTable 19-1.\\n Differentiating Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis]\\nSeveral gene mutations conferring a higher risk of Crohn's disease (and some possibly related to UC)\\nhave been identified.\\nCigarette smoking seems to contribute to development or exacerbation of Crohn's disease but decreases\\nrisk of UC. NSAIDs may exacerbate IBD.\\nExtraintestinal Manifestations\\nCrohn's disease and UC both affect organs other than the intestines. Most extraintestinal manifestations\\nare more common in UC and Crohn's colitis than in Crohn's disease limited to the small bowel.\\nExtraintestinal manifestations are categorized in 3 ways:\\n1. Disorders that usually parallel (ie, wax and wane with) IBD flare-ups. These disorders include\\nperipheral arthritis, episcleritis, aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum.\\nArthritis tends to involve large joints and be migratory and transient. One or more of these parallel\\ndisorders develops in more than one third of patients hospitalized with IBD.\\n2. Disorders that are clearly associated with IBD but appear independently of IBD activity. These\\ndisorders include ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis, uveitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.\\nAnkylosing spondylitis occurs more commonly in IBD patients with the HLA-B27 antigen. Most patients\\nwith spinal or sacroiliac involvement have evidence of uveitis and vice versa. Primary sclerosing\\ncholangitis, which is a risk factor for cancer of the biliary tract, is strongly associated with UC or Crohn's\\ncolitis. Cholangitis may appear before or concurrently with the bowel disease or even 20 yr after\\ncolectomy.

Disorders that are consequences of disrupted bowel physiology. These disorders occur mainly in\\nsevere Crohn's disease of the small bowel. Malabsorption may result from extensive ileal resection and\\ncause deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin B\\n12\\n, or minerals, resulting in anemia, hypocalcemia,\\nhypomagnesemia, clotting disorders, and bone demineralization. In children, malabsorption retards\\ngrowth and development. Other disorders include kidney stones from excessive dietary oxalate\\nabsorption, hydroureter and hydronephrosis from ureteral compression by the intestinal inflammatory\\nprocess, gallstones from impaired ileal reabsorption of bile salts, and amyloidosis secondary to long-\\nstanding inflammatory and suppurative disease.\\nThromboembolic disease may occur as a result of multiple factors in all 3 categories.\\nTreatment\\n• Supportive care\\n• 5-Aminosalicylic acid\\n• Corticosteroids\\n• Immunomodulating drugs\\n• Anticytokine drugs\\n• Sometimes antibiotics (eg, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin) and probiotics\\nSeveral classes of drugs are helpful for IBD. Details of their selection and use are discussed under each\\ndisorder.\\n5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalamine):\\n 5-ASA blocks production of prostaglandins and\\nleukotrienes and has other beneficial effects on the inflammatory cascade. Because 5-ASA is active only\\nintraluminally and is rapidly absorbed by the proximal small bowel, it must be formulated for delayed\\nabsorption when given orally. Sulfasalazine, the original agent in this class, delays absorption by\\ncomplexing 5-ASA with a sulfa moiety, sulfapyridine. The complex is cleaved by bacterial flora in the lower\\nileum and colon, releasing the 5-ASA. The sulfa moiety, however, causes numerous adverse effects (eg,\\nnausea, dyspepsia, headache), interferes with folate (folic acid) absorption, and occasionally causes\\nserious adverse reactions (eg, hemolytic anemia or agranulocytosis and, rarely, hepatitis or pneumonitis).\\nReversible decreases in sperm count and motility occur in up to 80% of men. If used, sulfasalazine should\\nbe given with food, initially in a low dosage (eg, 0.5 g po bid) and gradually increased over several days\\nto 1 to 2 g bid to tid. Patients should take daily folate supplements 1 mg po and have CBC and liver tests\\nevery 6 to 12 mo. Acute interstitial nephritis secondary to mesalamine occurs rarely; periodic monitoring of\\nrenal function is advisable because most cases are reversible if recognized early.\\nNewer drugs that complex 5-ASA with other vehicles seem almost equally effective but have fewer\\nadverse effects. Olsalazine (a 5-ASA dimer) and balsalazide (5-ASA conjugated to an inactive compound)\\nare cleaved by bacterial azoreductases (as is sulfasalazine). These drugs are activated mainly in the\\ncolon and are less effective for proximal small-bowel disease. Olsalazine dosage is 500 to 1500 mg po\\nbid, and balsalazide is 2.25 g po tid. Olsalazine sometimes causes diarrhea, especially in patients with\\npancolitis. \\nThis problem is minimized by gradual escalation of dose and administration with meals.\\nOther forms of 5-ASA use delayed-release coatings. Asacol (typical dose 800 to 1200 mg po tid) is 5-ASA\\ncoated with an acrylic polymer whose pH solubility delays release of the drug until entry into the distal\\nileum and colon. Pentasa (1 g po qid) is 5-ASA encapsulated in ethylcellulose microgranules that release\\n35% of the drug in the small bowel. Two once/day formulations of mesalamine (Lialda, Apriso) are\\navailable; this less frequent dosing may improve adherence.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 19.

Dosage of azathioprine is usually 2.5 to 3.0 mg/kg po once/day\\nand 6-mercaptopurine 1.5 to 2.5 mg/kg po once/day but varies depending on individual metabolism. Signs\\nof bone marrow suppression must be monitored with regular WBC count (biweekly for 1 mo, then every 1\\nto 2 mo). Pancreatitis or high fever occurs in about 3 to 5% of patients; either is an absolute\\ncontraindication to rechallenge. Hepatotoxicity is rarer and can be screened by blood tests every 6 to 12\\nmo. Newly available blood tests that measure the activity of one of the enzymes that metabolize\\nazathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine and that directly measure metabolite levels may sometimes be helpful\\nin ensuring safe and effective drug dosages.\\nMethotrexate 15 to 25 mg po or sc weekly is of benefit to many patients with corticosteroid-refractory or\\ncorticosteroid-dependent Crohn's disease, even those who have not responded to azathioprine or 6-\\nmercaptopurine. Adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, and asymptomatic liver function test\\nabnormalities. Folate 1 mg po once/day may diminish some of the adverse effects. Alcohol use, obesity,\\ndiabetes, and possibly psoriasis are risk factors for hepatotoxicity. Patients with these conditions should\\nhave a liver biopsy after a total dose of 1.5 g, but otherwise, concerns over hepatotoxicity are too often\\nexaggerated. Pulmonary toxicity can also occur with methotrexate therapy.\\nCyclosporine, which blocks lymphocyte activation, may benefit patients with severe UC unresponsive to\\ncorticosteroids and who may otherwise require colectomy.

These mucosal lesions \\nmay develop into deep longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening\\nmucosal edema, creating a characteristic cobblestoned appearance to the bowel.\\nTransmural spread of inflammation leads to lymphedema and thickening of the bowel wall and mesentery.\\nMesenteric fat typically extends onto the serosal surface of the bowel. Mesenteric lymph nodes often\\nenlarge. Extensive inflammation may result in hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosae, fibrosis, and\\nstricture formation, which can lead to bowel obstruction. Abscesses are common, and fistulas often\\npenetrate into adjoining structures, including other loops of bowel, the bladder, or psoas muscle. Fistulas\\nmay even extend to the skin of the anterior abdomen or flanks. Independently of intra-abdominal disease\\nactivity, perianal fistulas and abscesses occur in 25 to 33% of cases; these complications are frequently\\nthe most troublesome aspects of Crohn\\'s disease.\\nNoncaseating granulomas can occur in lymph nodes, peritoneum, the liver, and all layers of the bowel\\nwall. Although pathognomonic when present, granulomas are not detected in about half of patients with\\nCrohn\\'s disease. The presence of granulomas does not seem to be related to the clinical course.\\nSegments of diseased bowel are sharply demarcated from adjacent normal bowel (\"skip areas\"); hence,\\nthe name regional enteritis. About 35% of Crohn\\'s disease cases involve the ileum alone (ileitis); about\\n45% involve the ileum and colon (ileocolitis), with a predilection for the right side of the colon; and about\\n20% involve the colon alone (granulomatous colitis), most of which, unlike ulcerative colitis (UC), spare\\nthe rectum. Occasionally, the entire small bowel is involved (jejunoileitis). The stomach, duodenum, or\\nesophagus is clinically involved only rarely, although microscopic evidence of disease is often detectable\\nin the gastric antrum, especially in younger patients. In the absence of surgical intervention, the disease\\nalmost never extends into areas of small bowel that are not involved at first diagnosis.\\nThere is an increased risk of cancer in affected small-bowel segments. Patients with colonic involvement\\nhave a long-term risk of colorectal cancer equal to that of UC, given the same extent and duration of\\ndisease.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe most common initial manifestation is chronic diarrhea with abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, and\\nweight loss. The abdomen is tender, and a mass or fullness may be palpable. Gross rectal bleeding is\\nunusual except in isolated colonic disease, which may manifest similarly to UC. Some patients present\\nwith an acute abdomen that simulates acute appendicitis or intestinal obstruction. About 33% of patients\\nhave perianal disease (especially fissures and fistulas), which is sometimes the most prominent or even\\ninitial complaint. In children, extraintestinal manifestations frequently predominate over GI symptoms;\\narthritis, FUO, anemia, or growth retardation may be a presenting symptom, whereas abdominal pain or\\ndiarrhea may be absent.\\nWith recurrent disease, symptoms vary. Pain is most common and occurs with both simple recurrence and\\nabscess formation. Patients with severe flare-up or abscess are likely to have marked tenderness,\\nguarding, rebound, and a general toxic appearance. Stenotic segments may cause bowel obstruction,\\nwith colicky pain, distention, obstipation, and vomiting. Adhesions from previous surgery may also cause\\nbowel obstruction, which begins rapidly, without the prodrome of fever, pain, and malaise typical of\\nobstruction due to a Crohn\\'s disease flare-up. An enterovesical fistula may produce air bubbles in the\\nurine (pneumaturia). Draining cutaneous fistulas may occur.

Some genetic studies suggest a molecular basis for this classification.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Barium x-rays of the stomach, small bowel, and colon\\n• Abdominal CT (conventional or CT enterography)\\n• Sometimes magnetic resonance (MR) enterography, upper endoscopy, and/or colonoscopy\\nCrohn's disease should be suspected in a patient with inflammatory or obstructive symptoms or in a\\npatient without prominent GI symptoms but with perianal fistulas or abscesses or with otherwise\\nunexplained arthritis, erythema nodosum, fever, anemia, or (in a child) stunted growth. A family history of\\nCrohn's disease also increases the index of suspicion. Similar symptoms and signs (eg, abdominal pain,\\ndiarrhea) may be caused by other GI disorders. Differentiation from UC (see \\nTable 19-1\\n) may be an issue\\nin the 20% of cases in which Crohn's disease is confined to the colon. However, because treatment is\\nsimilar, this distinction is critical only when surgery or experimental therapy is contemplated.\\nPatients presenting with an acute abdomen (either initially or on relapse) should have flat and upright\\nabdominal x-rays and an abdominal CT scan. These studies may show obstruction, abscesses or fistulas,\\nand other possible causes of an acute abdomen (eg, appendicitis). Ultrasound may better delineate\\ngynecologic pathology in women with lower abdominal and pelvic pain.\\nIf initial presentation is less acute, an upper GI series with small-bowel follow-through and spot films of\\nthe terminal ileum is preferred over conventional CT. However, newer techniques of CT or MR\\nenterography, which combine high-resolution CT or MR imaging with large volumes of ingested contrast,\\nare becoming the procedures of choice in some centers. These imaging studies are virtually diagnostic if\\nthey show characteristic strictures or fistulas with accompanying separation of bowel loops. If findings are\\nquestionable, CT enteroclysis or video capsule enteroscopy may show superficial aphthous and linear\\nulcers. Barium enema x-ray may be used if symptoms seem predominantly colonic (eg, diarrhea) and may\\nshow reflux of barium into the terminal ileum with irregularity, nodularity, stiffness, wall thickening, and a\\nnarrowed lumen. Differential diagnoses in patients with similar x-ray findings include cancer of the cecum,\\nileal carcinoid, lymphoma, systemic vasculitis, radiation enteritis, ileocecal TB, and ameboma.\\nIn atypical cases (eg, predominantly diarrhea, with minimal pain), evaluation is similar to suspected UC,\\nwith colonoscopy (including biopsy, sampling for enteric pathogens, and, when possible, visualization of\\nthe terminal ileum). Upper GI endoscopy may identify subtle gastroduodenal involvement even in the\\nabsence of upper GI symptoms.\\nLaboratory tests should be done to screen for anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and electrolyte abnormalities.\\nLiver function tests should be done; elevated alkaline phosphatase and \\nγ\\n-glutamyl transpeptidase levels\\nin patients with major colonic involvement suggest possible primary sclerosing cholangitis. Leukocytosis\\nor increased levels of acute-phase reactants (eg, ESR, C-reactive protein) are nonspecific but may be\\nused serially to monitor disease activity.\\nPerinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are present in 60 to 70% of patients with UC and in only\\n5 to 20% of patients with Crohn's disease. Anti-\\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\\n antibodies are relatively\\nspecific for Crohn's disease. However, these tests do not reliably separate the 2 diseases. They have\\nuncertain value in cases of indeterminate colitis and are not recommended for routine diagnosis.\\nPrognosis\\nEstablished Crohn's disease is rarely cured but is characterized by intermittent exacerbations and\\nremissions. Some patients have severe disease with frequent, debilitating periods of pain. However, with\\njudicious medical therapy and, where appropriate, surgical therapy, most patients function well and adapt\\nsuccessfully. Disease-related mortality is very low.

Extraintestinal symptoms, particularly\\narthritis, may occur. Long-term risk of colon cancer is high. Diagnosis is by colonoscopy.\\nTreatment is with 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anticytokines,\\nantibiotics, and occasionally surgery.\\nPathophysiology\\nUC usually begins in the rectum. It may remain localized to the rectum (ulcerative proctitis) or extend\\nproximally, sometimes involving the entire colon. Rarely, it involves most of the large bowel at once.\\nThe inflammation caused by UC affects the mucosa and submucosa, and there is a sharp border\\nbetween normal and affected tissue. Only in severe disease is the muscularis involved. In early cases, the\\nmucous membrane is erythematous, finely granular, and friable, with loss of the normal vascular pattern\\nand often with scattered hemorrhagic areas. Large mucosal ulcers with copious purulent exudate\\ncharacterize severe disease. Islands of relatively normal or hyperplastic inflammatory mucosa\\n(pseudopolyps) project above areas of ulcerated mucosa. Fistulas and abscesses do not occur.\\nToxic or fulminant colitis\\n occurs when transmural extension of ulceration results in localized ileus and\\nperitonitis. Within hours to days, the colon loses muscular tone and begins to dilate. The terms toxic\\nmegacolon or toxic dilation are discouraged because the toxic inflammatory state and its complications\\ncan occur without frank megacolon (defined as transverse colon > 6 cm diameter during an exacerbation).\\nToxic colitis is a medical emergency that usually occurs spontaneously in the course of very severe colitis\\nbut is sometimes precipitated by opioid or anticholinergic antidiarrheal drugs.

Localized\\ndisease that later extends is often more severe and more refractory to therapy.\\nColon cancer:\\n The risk of colon cancer is proportional to the duration of disease and amount of colon\\naffected, but not necessarily to the clinical severity of the attacks. Some recent studies suggest that\\nsustained microscopic inflammation is a risk factor, and that use of aminosalicylate to control inflammation\\nis protective. Cancer begins to appear by 7 yr from onset of illness in patients with extensive colitis. The\\ncumulative likelihood of cancer is about 3% at 15 yr, 5% at 20 yr, and 9% at 25 yr, representing an annual\\nrisk of about 0.5 to 1% after the 10th yr. There is probably no higher absolute cancer risk among patients\\nwith childhood-onset colitis independent of the longer duration of disease. However, patients who have\\ninflammatory bowel disease and primary sclerosing cholangitis are at a higher risk of cancer from the time\\nof colitis diagnosis.\\nRegular colonoscopic surveillance, preferably during remission, is advised for patients with disease\\nduration > 8 to 10 yr (except for those with isolated proctitis). Endoscopic biopsies should be taken every\\n10 cm throughout the colon. Newer techniques, especially chromoendoscopy, may better identify areas of\\nsuspicion in preference to totally random biopsies. Any grade of definite dysplasia within an area affected\\nby colitis is liable to progress to more advanced neoplasia and even cancer and is a strong indication for\\ntotal colectomy unless the dysplasia is strictly confined to a discrete, completely excisable polyp. It is\\nimportant to distinguish definite neoplastic dysplasia from reactive or regenerative atypia secondary to\\ninflammation. However, if the dysplasia is unequivocal, delaying colectomy in favor of \\nrepeated follow-up\\nsurveillance is a risky strategy. Pseudopolyps have no prognostic significance but may be difficult to\\ndistinguish from neoplastic polyps; thus, any suspect polyp should undergo excision biopsy.\\nThe optimal frequency of colonoscopic surveillance has not been established, but some authorities\\nrecommend every 2 yr during the 2nd decade of disease and annually thereafter.\\nLong-term survival after diagnosis of colitis-related cancer is about 50%, a figure comparable to that for\\ncolorectal cancer in the general population.\\nTreatment\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 19.

Diverticular Disease\\nIntroduction\\nDiverticula are saclike mucosal outpouchings that protrude from a tubular structure. True diverticula\\ncontain all layers of the parent structure. False or pseudodiverticula are mucosal projections through the\\nmuscular layer. Esophageal (see p. \\n125\\n) and Meckel's diverticula are true diverticula. Colonic diverticula\\nare pseudodiverticula; they cause symptoms by trapping feces and becoming inflamed or infected,\\nbleeding, or rupturing.\\nDiverticulosis\\nDiverticulosis is the presence of multiple diverticula in the colon, probably resulting from a\\nlifelong low-fiber diet. Most diverticula are asymptomatic, but some become inflamed or bleed.\\nDiagnosis is by colonoscopy or barium enema. Treatment varies depending on manifestation.\\nDiverticula occur anywhere in the large bowel—usually in the sigmoid but rarely below the peritoneal\\nreflection of the rectum. They vary in diameter from 3 mm to > 3 cm. \\nPatients with diverticula usually have\\nseveral of them. Diverticulosis is uncommon in people < 40 but becomes common rapidly thereafter;\\nessentially every 90-yr-old person has many diverticula. Giant diverticula, which are rare, range in\\ndiameter from 3 to 15 cm and may be single.\\nPathophysiology\\nDiverticula are probably caused by increased intraluminal pressure leading to mucosal extrusion through\\nthe weakest points of the muscular layer of the bowel—areas adjacent to intramural blood vessels.\\nDiverticula are more common among people who eat a low-fiber diet; however, the mechanism is not\\nclear. One theory is that increased intraluminal pressure is required to move low-bulk stool through the\\ncolon. Another theory is that low-stool bulk causes a smaller diameter colon, which by Laplace's law\\nwould have increased pressure.\\nThe etiology of giant diverticula is unclear. One theory is that a valvelike abnormality exists at the base of\\nthe diverticulum, so bowel gas can enter but escapes less freely.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost (70%) diverticula are asymptomatic, 15 to 25% become painfully inflamed (diverticulitis), and 10 to\\n15% bleed painlessly. The bleeding is probably caused by erosion of the adjacent vessel by local trauma\\nfrom impacted feces in the diverticulum. Although most diverticula are distal, 75% of bleeding occurs from\\ndiverticula proximal to the splenic flexure. In 33% of patients (5% overall), bleeding is serious enough to\\nrequire transfusion.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Usually colonoscopy\\nAsymptomatic diverticula are usually found incidentally during barium enema or colonoscopy.\\nDiverticulosis is suspected when painless rectal bleeding develops, particularly in an elderly patient.\\nEvaluation of rectal bleeding typically includes colonoscopy, which can be done electively after routine\\npreparation unless there is significant ongoing bleeding. In such patients, a rapid preparation (5 to 10 L of\\npolyethylene glycol solution delivered via NGT over 3 to 4 h) often allows adequate visualization. If\\ncolonoscopy cannot visualize the source and ongoing bleeding is sufficiently rapid (> 0.5 to 1 mL/min),\\nangiography may localize the source.

Antispasmodics (eg, belladonna) are not of benefit and may cause adverse\\neffects. Surgery is unwarranted for uncomplicated disease. Giant diverticula, however, require surgery.\\nDiverticular bleeding stops spontaneously in 75% of patients. Treatment is often given during diagnostic\\nprocedures. If angiography was done for diagnosis, ongoing bleeding can be controlled in 70 to 90% of\\npatients by intraarterial injection of vasopressin. In some cases, bleeding recurs within a few days and\\nrequires surgery.

Anorectal Disorders\\nIntroduction\\n(See also \\nForeign Bodies\\n on p. \\n139\\n and \\nAnorectal Cancer\\n on p. \\n195\\n.)\\nThe anal canal begins at the anal sphincter and ends at the anorectal junction (pectinate line,\\nmucocutaneous junction, dentate line), where there are 8 to 12 anal crypts and 5 to 8 papillae. The canal\\nis lined with anoderm, a continuation of the external skin. The anal canal and adjacent skin are\\ninnervated by somatic sensory nerves and are highly susceptible to painful stimuli. Venous drainage from\\nthe anal canal occurs through the caval system, but the anorectal junction can drain into both the portal\\nand caval systems. Lymphatics from the anal canal pass to the internal iliac nodes, the posterior vaginal\\nwall, and the inguinal nodes. The venous and lymphatic distributions determine how malignant disease\\nand infection spread.\\nThe rectum is a continuation of the sigmoid colon beginning at the level of the 3rd sacral vertebra and\\ncontinuing to the anorectal junction. The rectal lining consists of red, glistening glandular mucosa, which\\nhas an autonomic nerve supply and is relatively insensitive to pain. Venous drainage occurs through the\\nportal system. Lymphatic return from the rectum occurs along the superior hemorrhoidal vascular pedicle\\nto the inferior mesenteric and aortic nodes.\\nThe sphincteric ring encircling the anal canal is composed of the internal sphincter, the central portion of\\nthe levators, and components of the external sphincter. Anteriorly, it is more vulnerable to trauma, which\\ncan result in incontinence. The puborectalis forms a muscular sling around the rectum for support and\\nassistance in defecation.\\nHistory:\\n History should include the details of bleeding, pain, protrusion, discharge, swelling, abnormal\\nsensations, bowel movements, incontinence, stool characteristics, use of cathartics and enemas, and\\nabdominal and urinary symptoms. All patients should be asked about anal intercourse and other possible\\ncauses of trauma and infection.\\nPhysical examination:\\n Examination should be done gently and with good lighting. It consists of external\\ninspection, perianal and intrarectal digital palpation, abdominal examination, and rectovaginal bidigital\\npalpation. Anoscopy and rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy to 15 to 60 cm above the anal verge are often\\nincluded (see p. \\n98\\n). Inspection, palpation, and anoscopy and sigmoidoscopy are best done with the\\npatient in the left lateral (Sims') position or inverted on a tilt table. In cases of painful anal lesions, topical\\n(lidocaine 5% ointment), regional, or even general anesthesia may be required.

An ischiorectal abscess is deeper, extending across\\nthe sphincter into the ischiorectal space below the levator ani; it may penetrate to the contralateral side,\\nforming a \"horseshoe\" abscess. An abscess above the levator ani (ie, supralevator abscess) is quite deep\\nand may extend to the peritoneum or abdominal organs; this abscess often results from diverticulitis or\\npelvic inflammatory disease. Crohn\\'s disease (especially of the colon) sometimes causes anorectal\\nabscess.

Leiomyoma, the\\nmost common, may be multiple but usually has an excellent prognosis.\\nEsophageal Cancer\\nThe most common malignant tumor in the proximal two thirds of the esophagus is squamous\\ncell carcinoma; adenocarcinoma is the most common in the distal one third. Symptoms are\\nprogressive dysphagia and weight loss. Diagnosis is by endoscopy, followed by CT and\\nendoscopic ultrasound for staging. Treatment varies with stage and generally includes surgery\\nwith or without chemotherapy and radiation. Long-term survival is poor except for those with\\nlocal disease.\\nEsophageal cancer accounts for an estimated 15,500 cases and 13,900 deaths in the US annually.\\nSquamous cell carcinoma:\\n About 8000 cases occur annually in the US. It is more common in parts of\\nAsia and in South Africa. In the US, it is 4 to 5 times more common among blacks than whites, and 2 to 3\\ntimes more common among men than women.\\nThe primary risk factors are alcohol ingestion and tobacco use (in any form). Other factors include\\nachalasia, human papillomavirus, lye ingestion (resulting in stricture), sclerotherapy, Plummer-Vinson\\nsyndrome, irradiation of the esophagus, and esophageal webs. Genetic causes are unclear, but 50% of\\npatients with tylosis (hyperkeratosis palmaris et plantaris), an autosomal dominant disorder, have\\nesophageal cancer by age 45, and 95% have it by age 55.\\nAdenocarcinoma:\\n Adenocarcinoma occurs in the distal esophagus. Its incidence is increasing; it\\naccounts for 50% of esophageal carcinoma in whites. It is 4 times more common among whites than\\nblacks. Alcohol is not an important risk factor, but smoking is contributory. Adenocarcinoma of the distal\\nesophagus is difficult to distinguish from adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia invading the distal\\nesophagus.\\nMost adenocarcinomas arise in Barrett's esophagus, which results from chronic gastroesophageal reflux\\ndisease and reflux esophagitis. In Barrett's esophagus, a metaplastic, columnar, glandular, intestine-like\\nmucosa with brush border and goblet cells replaces the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the\\ndistal esophagus during the healing phase of acute esophagitis when healing takes place in the\\ncontinued presence of stomach acid.\\nOther malignant tumors:\\n Less common malignant tumors include spindle cell carcinoma (a poorly\\ndifferentiated variant of squamous cell carcinoma), verrucous carcinoma (a well-differentiated variant of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma), pseudosarcoma, mucoepidermoid carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma,\\ncylindroma (adenoid cystic carcinoma), primary oat cell carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor,\\nsarcoma, and primary malignant melanoma.\\nMetastatic cancer constitutes 3% of esophageal cancer.

The original capsule is not useful in\\nthe stomach or colon because it tumbles in these larger organs; a colon capsule camera with better optics\\nand illumination is under development for use in these larger-diameter organs.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical resection\\nTreatment is surgical resection. Electrocautery, thermal obliteration, or laser phototherapy at the time of\\nenteroscopy or surgery may be an alternative to resection.\\nPolyps of the Colon and Rectum\\nAn intestinal polyp is any mass of tissue that arises from the bowel wall and protrudes into the\\nlumen. Most are asymptomatic except for minor bleeding, which is usually occult. The main\\nconcern is malignant transformation; most colon cancers arise in a previously benign\\nadenomatous polyp. Diagnosis is by endoscopy. Treatment is endoscopic removal.\\nPolyps may be sessile or pedunculated and vary considerably in size. Incidence of polyps ranges from 7\\nto 50%; the higher figure includes very small polyps (usually hyperplastic polyps or adenomas) found at\\nautopsy. Polyps, often multiple, occur most commonly in the rectum and sigmoid and decrease in\\nfrequency toward the cecum. Multiple polyps may represent familial adenomatous polyposis (see p. \\n192\\n).\\nAbout 25% of patients with cancer of the large bowel also have satellite adenomatous polyps.\\nAdenomatous (neoplastic) polyps\\n are of greatest concern. Such lesions are classified histologically as\\ntubular adenomas, tubulo-villous adenomas (villoglandular polyps), or villous adenomas. The likelihood of\\ncancer in an adenomatous polyp at the time of discovery is related to size, histologic type, and degree of\\ndysplasia; a 1.5-cm tubular adenoma has a 2% risk of containing a cancer vs a 35% risk in 3-cm villous\\nadenomas. Serrated adenomas, a somewhat more aggressive type of adenoma, may develop from\\nhyperplastic polyps.\\nNonadenomatous (nonneoplastic) polyps\\n include hyperplastic polyps, hamartomas, juvenile polyps,\\npseudopolyps, lipomas, leiomyomas, and other rarer tumors. Juvenile polyps occur in children, typically\\noutgrow their blood supply, and autoamputate some time during or after puberty. Treatment is required\\nonly for uncontrollable bleeding or intussusception. Inflammatory polyps and pseudopolyps occur in\\nchronic ulcerative colitis and in Crohn's disease of the colon. Multiple juvenile polyps (but not sporadic\\nones) convey an increased cancer risk. The specific number of polyps resulting in increased risk is not\\nknown.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost polyps are asymptomatic. Rectal bleeding, usually occult and rarely massive, is the most frequent\\ncomplaint. Cramps, abdominal pain, or obstruction may occur with a \\nlarge lesion.

Symptoms include blood in the stool or change\\nin bowel habits. Screening is with fecal occult blood testing. Diagnosis is by colonoscopy.\\nTreatment is surgical resection and chemotherapy for nodal involvement.\\nCRC accounts for an estimated 153,000 cases and 52,000 deaths in the US annually. In Western\\ncountries, the colon and rectum account for more new cases of cancer per year than any anatomic site\\nexcept the lung. Incidence begins to rise at age 40 and peaks at age 60 to 75. Overall, 70% of cases\\noccur in the rectum and sigmoid, and 95% are adenocarcinomas. Colon cancer is more common among\\nwomen; rectal cancer is more common among men. Synchronous cancers (more than one) occur in 5% of\\npatients.\\nEtiology\\nCRC most often occurs as transformation within adenomatous polyps. Serrated adenomas are particularly\\naggressive in their malignant transformation. About 80% of cases are sporadic, and 20% have an\\ninheritable component. Predisposing factors include chronic ulcerative colitis and granulomatous colitis;\\nthe risk of cancer increases with the duration of these disorders.\\nPopulations with a high incidence of CRC eat low-fiber diets that are high in animal protein, fat, and\\nrefined carbohydrates. Carcinogens may be ingested in the diet but are more likely produced by bacterial\\naction on dietary substances or biliary or intestinal secretions. The exact mechanism is unknown.\\nCRC spreads by direct extension through the bowel wall, hematogenous metastasis, regional lymph node\\nmetastasis, perineural spread, and intraluminal metastasis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nColorectal adenocarcinoma grows slowly, and a long interval elapses before it is large enough to cause\\nsymptoms. Symptoms depend on lesion location, type, extent, and complications.\\nThe right colon has a large caliber, a thin wall, and its contents are liquid; thus, obstruction is a late event.\\nBleeding is usually occult. Fatigue and weakness caused by severe anemia may be the only complaints.\\nTumors sometimes grow large enough to be palpable through the abdominal wall before other symptoms\\nappear.\\nThe left colon has a smaller lumen, the feces are semisolid, and cancer tends to encircle the bowel,\\ncausing alternating constipation and increased stool frequency or diarrhea. Partial obstruction with colicky\\nabdominal pain or complete obstruction may be the initial manifestation. The stool may be streaked or\\nmixed with blood. Some patients present with symptoms of perforation, usually walled off (focal pain and\\ntenderness), or rarely with diffuse peritonitis.\\nIn rectal cancer, the most common initial symptom is bleeding with defecation. Whenever\\n[\\nTable 22-2.\\n Staging Colorectal Cancer*]\\nrectal bleeding occurs, even with obvious hemorrhoids or known diverticular disease, coexisting cancer\\nmust be ruled out.

Cancer detected by this method tends to be at an earlier stage and hence more curable. For\\naverage-risk patients, FOB testing should be done annually after age 50, with flexible sigmoidoscopy\\nevery 5 yr. Some authorities recommend colonoscopy every 10 yr instead of sigmoidoscopy. Colonoscopy\\nevery 3 yr may be even better. Screening of patients with high-risk conditions (eg, ulcerative colitis) is\\ndiscussed under the specific condition.\\nCT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) generates 3D and 2D images of the colon using multidetector row\\nCT and a combination of oral contrast and gas distention of the colon. Viewing the high-resolution 3D\\nimages somewhat simulates the appearance of optical endoscopy, hence the name. It has some promise\\nas a screening test for people who are unable or unwilling to undergo endoscopic colonoscopy but is less\\nsensitive and highly interpreter dependent. It avoids the need for sedation but still requires thorough\\nbowel preparation, and the gas distention may be uncomfortable. Additionally, unlike with optical\\ncolonoscopy, lesions cannot be biopsied during the diagnostic procedure.\\nVideo capsule endoscopy of the colon has many technical problems and is not currently acceptable as a\\nscreening test.\\nDiagnostic tests:\\n Patients with positive FOB tests require colonoscopy, as do those with lesions seen on\\nsigmoidoscopy or imaging study. All lesions should be completely removed for histologic examination. If a\\nlesion is sessile or not removable at colonoscopy, surgical excision should be strongly considered.\\nBarium enema x-ray, particularly a double-contrast study, can detect many lesions but is somewhat less\\naccurate than colonoscopy and is not preferred as follow up to a positive FOB test.\\nOnce cancer is diagnosed, patients should have abdominal CT, chest x-ray, and routine laboratory tests\\nto seek metastatic disease and anemia and to evaluate overall condition.\\nElevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels are present in 70% of patients with CRC, but this\\ntest is not specific and therefore is not recommended for screening. However, if CEA is high\\npreoperatively and low after removal of a colon tumor, monitoring CEA may help to detect recurrence\\nearlier. CA 199 and CA 125 are other tumor markers that may be similarly used.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends greatly on stage (see \\nTable 22-2\\n). The 10-yr survival rate for cancer limited to the\\nmucosa approaches 90%; with extension through the bowel wall, 70 to 80%; with positive lymph nodes,\\n30 to 50%; and with metastatic disease, < 20%.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical resection, sometimes combined with chemotherapy, radiation, or both\\nSurgery:\\n Surgery for cure can be attempted in the 70% of patients presenting without metastatic\\ndisease. Attempt to cure consists of wide resection of the tumor and its regional lymphatic drainage with\\nreanastomosis of bowel segments. If there is ≤ 5 cm of normal bowel present between the lesion and the\\nanal verge, an abdominoperineal resection is done, with permanent colostomy.\\nResection of a limited number (1 to 3) of liver metastases is recommended in select nondebilitated\\npatients as a subsequent procedure. Criteria include those whose primary tumor has been resected,\\nwhose liver metastases are in one hepatic lobe, and who have no extrahepatic metastases. Only a small\\nnumber of patients with liver metastases meet these criteria, but 5-yr postoperative survival is 25%.\\nAdjuvant therapy:\\n Chemotherapy (typically 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin) improves survival by 10 to\\n30% in colon cancer patients with positive lymph nodes.

Metastasis occurs along the lymphatics of the rectum and into the inguinal lymph nodes.\\nRisk factors include infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), chronic fistulas, irradiated anal skin,\\nleukoplakia, lymphogranuloma venereum, and condyloma acuminatum. Gay men practicing receptive anal\\nintercourse are at increased risk. Patients with HPV infection may manifest dysplasia in slightly abnormal\\nor normal-appearing anal epithelium (anal intraepithelial neoplasia—histologically graded I, II, or III).\\nThese changes are more common among HIV-infected patients, particularly gay men. Higher grades may\\nprogress to invasive carcinoma. It is unclear whether early recognition and eradication improve long-term\\noutcome; hence, screening recommendations are unclear.\\nWide local excision is often satisfactory treatment of perianal carcinomas. Combination chemotherapy\\nand radiation therapy result in a high rate of cure when used for anal squamous and cloacogenic tumors.\\nAbdominoperineal resection is indicated when radiation \\nand chemotherapy do not result in complete\\nregression of tumor and there are no metastases outside of the radiation field.\\nHereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Carcinoma\\nHereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) is an autosomal dominant disorder\\nresponsible for 3 to 5% of cases of colorectal cancer (CRC).

These levels are normal or low in patients with surreptitious insulin\\nadministration.\\nBecause many patients have no symptoms (and hence no hypoglycemia) at the time of evaluation,\\ndiagnosis requires admission to the hospital for a 48- or 72-h fast. Nearly all (98%) with insulinoma\\ndevelop symptoms within 48 h of fasting; 70 to 80% within 24 h. Hypoglycemia as the cause of the\\nsymptoms is established by Whipple's triad: (1) Symptoms occur during the fast; (2) symptoms occur in\\nthe presence of hypoglycemia; and (3) ingestion of carbohydrates relieves the symptoms. Hormone levels\\nare obtained as described above when the patient is having symptoms.\\nIf Whipple's triad is not observed after prolonged fasting and the plasma glucose after an overnight fast is\\n> 50 mg/dL (> 2.78 mmol/L), a C-peptide suppression test can be done. During insulin infusion (0.1\\nU/kg/h), patients with insulinoma fail to suppress C peptide to normal levels (≤ 1.2 ng/mL [≤ 0.40 nmol/L]).\\nEndoscopic ultrasonography has > 90% sensitivity and helps localize the tumor. PET also may be used.\\nCT has not proved useful, and arteriography or selective portal and splenic vein catheterization is\\ngenerally unnecessary.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical resection\\n• Diazoxide or sometimes octreotide for hypoglycemia\\nOverall surgical cure rates approach 90%. A small, single insulinoma at or near the \\nsurface of the\\npancreas can usually be enucleated surgically. If a single large or deep adenoma is within the pancreatic\\nbody or tail, if there are multiple lesions of the body or tail (or both), or if no insulinoma is found (an\\nunusual circumstance), a distal, subtotal pancreatectomy is done. In < 1% of cases, the insulinoma is\\nectopically located in peripancreatic sites of the duodenal wall or periduodenal area and can be found\\nonly by diligent search during surgery. Pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) is done for\\nresectable malignant insulinomas of the proximal pancreas. Total pancreatectomy is done if a previous\\nsubtotal pancreatectomy proves inadequate.\\nIf hypoglycemia continues, diazoxide starting at 1.5 mg/kg po bid with a natriuretic can be used. Doses\\ncan be increased up to 4 mg/kg. A somatostatin analog, octreotide (100 to 500 \\nμ\\ng sc bid to tid), is variably\\neffective and should be considered for patients with continuing hypoglycemia refractory to diazoxide.\\nPatients who respond may be converted to a long-acting octreotide formulation given as 20 to 30 mg IM\\nonce/mo. Patients using octreotide may also need to take supplemental pancreatic enzymes because\\noctreotide suppresses pancreatic enzyme secretion. Other drugs that have modest and variable effect on\\ninsulin secretion include verapamil, diltiazem, and phenytoin.\\nIf symptoms are not controlled, chemotherapy may be tried, but response is limited. Streptozotocin has a\\n30 to 40% response rate, and when combined with 5-fluorouracil, a 60% response rate lasting up to 2 yr.\\nOther agents include doxorubicin, chlorozotocin, and interferon.\\nZollinger-Ellison Syndrome\\n(Z-E Syndrome; Gastrinoma)\\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrin-producing tumor usually located in the\\npancreas or the duodenal wall. Gastric acid hypersecretion and peptic ulceration result.\\nDiagnosis is by measuring serum gastrin levels.

Approach to the Patient With Liver Disease\\nIntroduction\\nThe liver is the most metabolically complex organ. Hepatocytes (liver parenchymal cells) perform the\\nliver's metabolic functions:\\n• Formation and excretion of bile during bilirubin metabolism (see \\nSidebar 23-1\\n)\\n• Regulation of carbohydrate homeostasis\\n• Lipid synthesis and secretion of plasma lipoproteins\\n• Control of cholesterol metabolism\\n• Formation of urea, serum albumin, clotting factors, enzymes, and numerous other proteins\\n• Metabolism or detoxification of drugs and other foreign substances\\nAt the cellular level, portal triads consist of adjacent and parallel terminal branches of bile ducts, portal\\nveins, and hepatic arteries that border the hepatocytes (see\\nFig. 23-1\\n). Terminal branches of the hepatic veins are in the center of hepatic lobules. Because blood\\nflows from the portal triads past the hepatocytes and drains via vein branches in the center of the lobule,\\nthe center of the lobule is the area most susceptible to ischemia.\\nPathophysiology\\nLiver disorders can result from a wide variety of insults, including infections, drugs, toxins, ischemia, and\\nautoimmune disorders. Occasionally, liver disorders occur postoperatively (see p. \\n223\\n). Most liver\\ndisorders cause some degree of hepatocellular injury and necrosis, resulting in various abnormal\\nlaboratory test results and, sometimes, symptoms.\\n[\\nFig. 23-1.\\n Organization of the liver.]\\nSymptoms may be due to liver disease itself (eg, jaundice due to acute hepatitis) or to complications of\\nliver disease (eg, acute GI bleeding due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension).\\nSidebar 23-1 Overview of Bilirubin Metabolism\\nThe breakdown of heme produces bilirubin (an insoluble waste product) and other bile pigments. Bilirubin\\nmust be made water soluble to be excreted. This transformation occurs in 5 steps: formation, plasma\\ntransport, liver uptake, conjugation, and biliary excretion.\\nFormation:\\n About 250 to 350 mg of unconjugated bilirubin forms daily; 70 to 80% derives from the\\nbreakdown of degenerating RBCs, and 20 to 30% (early-labeled bilirubin) derives primarily from other\\nheme proteins in the bone marrow and liver. Hb is degraded to iron and biliverdin, which is converted to\\nbilirubin.\\nPlasma transport:\\n Unconjugated (indirect-reacting) bilirubin is not water soluble and so is transported in\\nthe plasma bound to albumin. It cannot pass through the glomerular membrane into the urine. Albumin\\nbinding weakens under certain conditions (eg, acidosis), and some substances (eg, salicylates, certain\\nantibiotics) compete for the binding sites.\\nLiver uptake:\\n The liver takes up bilirubin rapidly but does not take up the attached serum albumin.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 23.

This reaction, catalyzed by the microsomal enzyme glucuronyl\\ntransferase, renders the bilirubin water soluble.\\nBiliary excretion:\\n Tiny canaliculi formed by adjacent hepatocytes progressively coalesce into ductules,\\ninterlobular bile ducts, and larger hepatic ducts. Outside the porta hepatis, the main hepatic duct joins the\\ncystic duct from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct, which drains into the duodenum at the\\nampulla of Vater.\\nConjugated bilirubin is secreted into the bile canaliculus with other bile constituents. In the intestine,\\nbacteria metabolize bilirubin to form urobilinogen, much of which is further metabolized to stercobilins,\\nwhich render the stool brown. In complete biliary obstruction, stools lose their normal color and become\\nlight gray (clay-colored stool). Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed, extracted by hepatocytes, and re-\\nexcreted in bile (enterohepatic circulation). A small amount is excreted in urine.\\nBecause conjugated bilirubin is excreted in urine and unconjugated bilirubin is not, only conjugated\\nhyperbilirubinemia (eg, due to hepatocellular or cholestatic jaundice) causes bilirubinuria.\\nDespite necrosis, the liver can regenerate itself. Even extensive patchy necrosis can resolve completely\\n(eg, in acute viral hepatitis). Incomplete regeneration and fibrosis, however, may result from injury that\\nbridges entire lobules or from less pronounced but ongoing damage.\\nSpecific diseases preferentially affect certain hepatobiliary structures or functions (eg, acute viral hepatitis\\nis primarily manifested by damage to hepatocytes or hepatocellular injury; primary biliary cirrhosis, by\\nimpairment of biliary secretion; and cryptogenic cirrhosis, by liver fibrosis and resultant portal venous\\nhypertension). The part of the hepatobiliary system affected determines the symptoms, signs, and\\nlaboratory abnormalities (see also \\nCh. 24\\n). Some disorders (eg, severe alcoholic liver disease) affect\\nmultiple liver structures, resulting in a combination of patterns of symptoms, signs, and laboratory\\nabnormalities.\\nThe prognosis of serious complications is worse in older adults, who are less able to recover from severe\\nphysiologic stresses and to tolerate toxic accumulations.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory:\\n Various symptoms may develop, but few are specific for liver disorders:\\n• Common nonspecific symptoms include fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and, occasionally, vomiting,\\nparticularly in severe disorders.\\n• Loose, fatty stools (steatorrhea) can occur when cholestasis prevents sufficient bile from reaching the\\nintestines.

Clinically, it is most useful to distinguish fatty liver due to pregnancy or\\nalcoholic liver disease (see p. \\n235\\n) from that occurring in the absence of pregnancy and alcoholism\\n(nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]). NAFLD includes simple fatty infiltration (a benign condition)\\nand nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a less common but more important variant.\\n(See also the American Gastroenterological Association's Medical Position Statement and Technical\\nReview on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.)\\nNonalcoholic Steatohepatitis\\nNonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a syndrome that develops in patients who are not\\nalcoholics; it causes liver damage that is histologically indistinguishable from alcoholic\\nhepatitis. It develops most often in patients with at least one of the following risk factors:\\nobesity, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance. Pathogenesis is poorly understood but seems to\\nbe linked to insulin resistance (eg, as in obesity or metabolic syndrome). Most patients are\\nasymptomatic. Laboratory findings include elevations in aminotransferase levels. Biopsy is\\nrequired to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes elimination of causes and risk factors.\\nNASH (sometimes called steatonecrosis) is diagnosed most often in patients between 40 yr and 60 yr but\\ncan occur in all age groups. Many affected patients have obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, or\\ndyslipidemia.\\nPathophysiology\\nPathophysiology involves fat accumulation (steatosis), inflammation, and, variably, fibrosis. Steatosis\\nresults from hepatic triglyceride accumulation. Possible mechanisms for steatosis include reduced\\nsynthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and increased hepatic triglyceride synthesis (possibly\\ndue to decreased oxidation of fatty acids or increased free fatty acids being delivered to the liver).\\nInflammation may result from lipid peroxidative damage to cell membranes. These changes can stimulate\\nhepatic stellate cells, resulting in fibrosis. If advanced, NASH can cause cirrhosis and portal hypertension.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost patients are asymptomatic. However, some have fatigue, malaise, or right upper quadrant abdominal\\ndiscomfort. Hepatomegaly develops in about 75% of patients.

However, other potentially reversible factors contribute; they include contractility of sinusoidal\\nlining cells, production of vasoactive substances (eg, endothelins, nitric oxide), various systemic\\nmediators of arteriolar resistance, and possibly swelling of hepatocytes.\\nOver time, portal hypertension creates portal-systemic venous collaterals. They may slightly decrease\\nportal vein pressure but can cause complications. Engorged serpentine submucosal vessels (varices) in\\nthe distal esophagus and sometimes in the gastric fundus can rupture, causing sudden, catastrophic GI\\nbleeding. Bleeding rarely occurs unless the portal pressure gradient is > 12 mm Hg. Gastric mucosal\\nvascular congestion (portal hypertensive gastropathy) can cause acute or chronic bleeding independent\\nof varices. Visible abdominal wall collaterals are common; veins radiating from the umbilicus (caput\\nmedusae) are much rarer and indicate extensive flow in the umbilical and periumbilical veins.\\n[\\nTable 23-7.\\n Most Common Causes of Portal Hypertension]\\nCollaterals around the rectum can cause rectal varices that can bleed.\\nPortal-systemic collaterals shunt blood away from the liver. Thus, less blood reaches the liver when portal\\nflow increases (diminished hepatic reserve). In addition, toxic substances from the intestine are shunted\\ndirectly to the systemic circulation, contributing to portal-systemic encephalopathy (see p. \\n220\\n). Venous\\ncongestion within visceral organs due to portal hypertension contributes to ascites via altered Starling's\\nforces. Splenomegaly and hypersplenism (see p. \\n984\\n) commonly occur as a result of increased splenic\\nvein pressure. Thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and, less commonly, hemolytic anemia may result.\\nPortal hypertension is often associated with a hyperdynamic circulation. Mechanisms are complex and\\nseem to involve altered sympathetic tone, production of nitric oxide and other endogenous vasodilators,\\nand enhanced activity of humoral factors (eg, glucagon).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPortal hypertension is asymptomatic; symptoms and signs result from its complications. The most\\ndangerous is acute variceal bleeding (see p. \\n103\\n). Patients typically present with sudden painless upper\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 23.

Testing for Hepatic and Biliary Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nDiagnosis of liver and biliary system disorders may include laboratory tests, imaging tests, and liver\\nbiopsy. Individual tests, particularly those of liver biochemistry and excretion, often have limited sensitivity\\nand specificity. A combination of tests often best defines the cause and severity of disease. Useful\\nalgorithms (eg, Model of End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD], Child-Pugh score) have incorporated clinical\\nand laboratory features to predict survival in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.\\nLaboratory Tests\\nLaboratory tests are generally effective for the following:\\n• Detecting hepatic dysfunction\\n• Assessing the severity of liver injury\\n• Monitoring the course of liver diseases and the response to treatment\\n• Refining the diagnosis\\nMany tests of liver biochemistry and excretory performance are called liver function tests. However, rather\\nthan assessing liver function, several of these tests measure liver enzymes that are released into the\\nbloodstream (eg, release of aminotransferases from injured liver cells or of alkaline phosphatase due to\\ncholestasis). Only certain tests actually assess liver \\nfunction by evaluating hepatobiliary excretion (eg,\\nbilirubin) or the liver's synthetic capability (eg, PT, usually reported as the INR; albumin).\\nThe most useful laboratory tests to screen for liver disorders are serum aminotransferases (the most\\ncommonly used liver function tests), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Certain patterns of biochemical\\nabnormalities help distinguish hepatocellular injury from impaired bile excretion (cholestasis—see\\nTable 24-1\\n). Tests that detect viral hepatitis, liver inflammation, or altered immunoregulation include\\nhepatitis serologic tests (see p. \\n251\\n) and measurement of immunoglobulins, antibodies, and\\nautoantibodies.\\nA few laboratory tests are diagnostic by themselves; they include the following:\\n• IgM antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) for acute hepatitis A\\n• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for hepatitis B\\n• Antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and HCV-RNA for hepatitis C\\n• Antimitochondrial antibody for primary biliary cirrhosis\\n• Serum ceruloplasmin (reduced) and urinary copper (elevated) for Wilson's disease\\n• Serum \\nα\\n1\\n-antitrypsin for \\nα\\n1\\n-antitrypsin deficiency\\n• \\nα\\n-Fetoprotein for hepatocellular carcinoma\\nTests for Liver Injury\\nAminotransferases:\\n Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) leak from\\ndamaged cells; thus, these enzymes are sensitive indicators of liver injury.

Sometimes alterations increase levels of bioavailable drug, causing normal drug doses to have\\ntoxic effects. However, levels and effects for an individual drug are unpredictable and do not correlate\\nwell with the type of liver injury, its severity, or liver function test results. Thus, no general rules are\\navailable for modifying drug dosage in patients with liver disease.\\nClinical effects can vary independent of drug bioavailability, especially in chronic liver disease; eg,\\ncerebral sensitivity to opioids and sedatives is often enhanced in patients with chronic liver disease.\\nThus, seemingly small doses of these drugs given to cirrhotic patients may precipitate encephalopathy.\\nThe mechanism of this effect probably involves alterations in cerebral drug receptors.\\nAdverse drug reactions do not appear to be more likely in patients with advanced liver disease; however,\\nsuch patients may tolerate any hepatic adverse effects of drugs less well.\\nLiver Injury Caused by Drugs\\nMany drugs (eg, statins) commonly cause asymptomatic elevation of hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline\\nphosphatase). However, clinically significant liver injury (eg, with jaundice, abdominal pain, or pruritus) or\\nimpaired liver function—ie, resulting in deficient protein synthesis (eg, with prolonged PT or with\\nhypoalbuminemia)—is rare.\\nThe term drug-induced liver injury (DILI) may be used to mean clinically significant liver injury or all\\n(including asymptomatic) liver injury. DILI includes injury caused by medicinal herbs, plants, and nutritional\\nsupplements as well as drugs.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe pathophysiology of DILI varies depending on the drug (or other hepatotoxin) and, in many cases, is\\nnot entirely understood. Drug-induced injury mechanisms include covalent binding of the drug to cellular\\nproteins resulting in immune injury, inhibition of cell metabolic pathways, blockage of cellular transport\\npumps, induction of apoptosis, and interference with mitochondrial function.\\nIn general, the following are thought to increase risk of DILI:\\n• Age ≥ 18 yr\\n• Obesity\\n• Pregnancy\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 25.

If hepatocellular liver injury is accompanied by jaundice, impaired hepatic synthesis,\\nand encephalopathy, chance of spontaneous recovery is low, and liver transplantation should be\\nconsidered. This type of injury can result from drugs such as acetaminophen and isoniazid.\\n• \\nCholestatic:\\n Cholestatic hepatotoxicity is characterized by development of pruritus and jaundice\\naccompanied by marked elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels.

The damaged hepatocytes are swollen with a\\ngranular cytoplasm (balloon degeneration) or contain fibrillar protein in the cytoplasm (Mallory or alcoholic\\nhyaline bodies). Severely damaged hepatocytes become necrotic. Sinusoids and terminal hepatic venules\\nare narrowed.

Alcoholic hepatitis may coexist. The feeble\\ncompensatory attempt at hepatic regeneration produces relatively small nodules (micronodular cirrhosis).\\nAs a result, the liver usually shrinks.

Fibrosis and Cirrhosis\\nIntroduction\\nIn hepatic fibrosis, excessive connective tissue accumulates in the liver; this tissue represents scarring in\\nresponse to chronic, repeated liver cell injury. Commonly, fibrosis progresses, disrupting hepatic\\narchitecture and eventually function, as regenerating hepatocytes attempt to replace and repair damaged\\ntissue. When such disruption is widespread, cirrhosis is diagnosed. To develop, cirrhosis usually requires\\n> 6 mo of liver disease but can occur more rapidly (eg, during infancy with biliary atresia, after liver\\ntransplantation for severe liver disease secondary to chronic hepatitis B or C).\\nFibrosis\\nHepatic fibrosis is overly exuberant wound healing in which excessive connective tissue builds\\nup in the liver. The extracellular matrix is overproduced, degraded deficiently, or both. The\\ntrigger is chronic injury, especially if there is an inflammatory component. Fibrosis itself causes\\nno symptoms but can lead to portal hypertension (the scarring distorts blood flow through the\\nliver) or cirrhosis (the scarring results in disruption of normal hepatic architecture and liver\\ndysfunction). Diagnosis is based on liver biopsy. Treatment involves correcting the underlying\\ncondition when possible.\\nVarious types of chronic liver injury can cause fibrosis (see\\nTable 27-1\\n). Self-limited, acute liver injury (eg, acute viral hepatitis A), even when fulminant, does not\\nnecessarily distort the scaffolding architecture and hence does not cause fibrosis, despite loss of\\nhepatocytes. In its initial stages, hepatic fibrosis can regress if the cause is reversible (eg, with viral\\nclearance). After months or years of chronic or repeated injury, fibrosis becomes permanent. Fibrosis\\ndevelops even more rapidly in mechanical biliary obstruction.\\nPathophysiology\\nActivation of the hepatic perivascular stellate cells (Ito cells, which store fat) initiates fibrosis. These and\\nadjacent cells proliferate, becoming contractile cells termed myofibroblasts. These cells produce\\nexcessive amounts of abnormal matrix (consisting of collagen, other glycoproteins, and glycans) and\\nmatricellular proteins. Kupffer cells (resident macrophages), injured hepatocytes, platelets, and\\nleukocytes aggregate. As a result, reactive O\\n2\\n species and inflammatory mediators (eg, platelet-derived\\ngrowth factor, transforming growth factors, and connective tissue growth factor) are released. Thus,\\nstellate cell activation results in abnormal extracellular matrix, both in quantity and composition.\\nMyofibroblasts, stimulated by endothelin-1, contribute to increased portal vein resistance and increase\\nthe density of the abnormal matrix. Fibrous tracts join branches of afferent portal veins and efferent\\nhepatic veins, bypassing the hepatocytes and limiting their blood supply. Hence, fibrosis contributes both\\nto hepatocyte ischemia (causing hepatocellular dysfunction) and portal hypertension. The\\n[\\nTable 27-1.\\n Disorders and Drugs that Can Cause Hepatic Fibrosis]\\nextent of the ischemia and portal hypertension determines how the liver is affected. For example,\\ncongenital hepatic fibrosis affects portal vein branches, largely sparing the parenchyma. The result is\\nportal hypertension with sparing of hepatocellular function.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nHepatic fibrosis itself does not cause symptoms. Symptoms may develop secondary to the primary\\ndisorder or to portal hypertension. Portal hypertension with splenomegaly is often asymptomatic unless\\ncomplications, such as variceal GI bleeding, ascites, or portal-systemic encephalopathy, develop.\\nEventually, cirrhosis supervenes.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 27.

Noninvasive tests (eg,\\nserologic markers) are under study but are not yet ready for routine clinical use. Imaging tests such as\\nultrasonography, CT, and MRI may detect findings associated with fibrosis (eg, portal hypertension,\\nsplenomegaly, cirrhosis) but are not sensitive to parenchymal fibrosis itself. Liver biopsy is currently the\\nonly means of detecting hepatic fibrosis. Biopsy is indicated to clarify the diagnosis (eg, nonalcoholic\\nsteatohepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis) and stage its progress (eg, in chronic hepatitis C to determine\\nwhether fibrosis is present or whether it has progressed to cirrhosis).\\nTreatment\\n• Treatment of cause\\nBecause fibrosis represents a response to hepatic damage, primary treatment should focus on the cause\\n(removing the basis of the liver injury). Such treatment may include eliminating HBC or HCV in chronic\\nviral hepatitis, abstaining from alcohol in alcoholic liver disease, removing heavy metals such as iron in\\nhemochromatosis or copper in Wilson's disease, and decompressing bile ducts in biliary obstruction.\\nTreatments aimed at reversing the fibrosis are usually too toxic for long-term use (eg, corticosteroids,\\npenicillamine) or have no proven efficacy (eg, colchicine). Other antifibrotic treatments are under study.\\nSimultaneous use of multiple antifibrotic drugs may eventually prove most beneficial.\\nCirrhosis\\nCirrhosis is a late stage of hepatic fibrosis that has resulted in widespread distortion of normal\\nhepatic architecture. Cirrhosis is characterized by regenerative nodules surrounded by dense\\nfibrotic tissue. Symptoms may not develop for years and are often nonspecific (eg, anorexia,\\nfatigue, weight loss). Late manifestations include portal hypertension, ascites, and, when\\ndecompensation occurs, liver failure. Diagnosis often requires liver biopsy. Cirrhosis is usually\\nconsidered irreversible. Treatment is supportive.\\nCirrhosis is a leading cause of death worldwide. The causes of cirrhosis are the same as those of fibrosis\\n(see \\nTable 27-1\\n). In developed countries, most cases result from chronic alcohol abuse or chronic\\nhepatitis C. In parts of Asia and Africa, cirrhosis often results from chronic hepatitis B. Cirrhosis of\\nunknown etiology (cryptogenic cirrhosis) is becoming less common as many specific causes (eg, chronic\\nhepatitis C, steatohepatitis) are identified. Injury to the bile ducts also can result in cirrhosis, as occurs in\\nmechanical bile duct obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis (see p. \\n244\\n), and primary sclerosing cholangitis\\n(see p. \\n278\\n).\\nPathophysiology\\nThere are 2 primary factors:\\n• Hepatic fibrosis\\n• Regenerating liver cells\\nIn response to injury and loss, growth regulators induce hepatocellular hyperplasia (producing\\nregenerating nodules) and arterial growth (angiogenesis). Among the growth regulators are cytokines and\\nhepatic growth factors (eg, epithelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-\\nα\\n, tumor necrosis factor). Insulin, glucagon, and patterns of intrahepatic blood flow determine how and\\nwhere nodules develop.\\nAngiogenesis produces new vessels within the fibrous sheath that surrounds nodules.

Such interconnecting vessels provide relatively low-volume, high-pressure venous drainage\\nthat cannot accommodate as much blood volume as normal. As a result, portal vein pressure increases.\\nSuch distortions in blood flow contribute to portal hypertension, which increases because the\\nregenerating nodules compress hepatic venules.\\nThe progression rate from fibrosis to cirrhosis and the morphology of cirrhosis vary from person to\\nperson. Presumably, the reason for such variation is the extent of exposure to the injurious stimulus and\\nthe individual's response.\\nComplications:\\n Portal hypertension (see p. \\n218\\n) is the most common serious complication; it can\\nmanifest as GI bleeding from esophageal, gastric, or rectal varices or portal hypertensive gastropathy.\\nPortal hypertension can be massive. Cirrhosis can cause other cardiovascular complications. Vasodilation\\nand intrapulmonary right-to-left shunting and ventilation/perfusion mismatch can result in hypoxia\\n(hepatopulmonary syndrome). A cardiac myopathy can also accompany cirrhosis.\\nAscites can develop, with a risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Splenic congestion with\\nhypersplenism may occur, resulting in splenomegaly, platelet sequestration, and consequent cytopenia.\\nProgressive loss of hepatic architecture impairs function, leading to hepatic insufficiency; it manifests as\\ncoagulopathy, renal failure (hepatorenal syndrome—see p. \\n223\\n), and hepatic encephalopathy.\\nHepatocytes secrete less bile, contributing to cholestasis and jaundice. Less bile in the intestine causes\\nmalabsorption of dietary fat (triglycerides) and fat-soluble vitamins. Malabsorption of vitamin D may\\ncontribute to osteoporosis. Undernutrition is common. It may result from anorexia with reduced food intake\\nor, in patients with alcoholic liver disease, from malabsorption due to pancreatic insufficiency.\\nBlood disorders are common. Anemia results from hypersplenism, chronic GI bleeding, folate deficiency\\n(particularly in patients with alcoholism), and hemolysis. Clotting may be impaired because of\\ncoagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. Coagulopathy results from impaired hepatic synthesis of the factors\\nnecessary for clotting, malabsorption of vitamin K due to impaired bile secretion into the duodenum, or\\nboth. Thrombocytopenia may be caused by hypersplenism (platelet sequestration), alcohol excess\\n(directly inhibiting the bone marrow), or both. Pancytopenia also occurs with alcoholism.\\nHepatocellular carcinoma frequently complicates cirrhosis, particularly cirrhosis resulting from chronic\\nhepatitis B and C viruses, hemochromatosis, alcohol-related liver disease, \\nα\\n1\\nantitrypsin deficiency, or\\nglycogen storage disease.\\nHistopathology:\\n Cirrhosis is characterized by regenerating nodules and fibrosis. Incompletely formed\\nliver nodules, nodules without fibrosis (nodular regenerative hyperplasia), and congenital hepatic fibrosis\\n(ie, widespread fibrosis without regenerating nodules) are not true cirrhosis.\\nCirrhosis can be micronodular or macronodular. Micronodular cirrhosis is characterized by uniformly small\\nnodules (< 3 mm in diameter) and thick regular bands of connective tissue. Typically, nodules lack lobular\\norganization; terminal (central) hepatic venules and portal triads are distorted. With time, macronodular\\ncirrhosis often develops. The nodules vary in size (3 mm to 5 cm in diameter) and have some rather\\nnormal lobular organization of portal triads and terminal hepatic venules. Broad fibrous bands of varying\\nthickness surround the large nodules. \\nCollapse of the normal hepatic architecture is suggested by the\\nconcentration of portal triads within the fibrous scars. Mixed cirrhosis (incomplete septal cirrhosis)\\ncombines elements of micronodular and macronodular cirrhosis. Differentiation between these\\nmorphologic types of cirrhosis has limited clinical value.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCirrhosis may be asymptomatic for years. One third of patients never develop symptoms. Often, the first\\nsymptoms are nonspecific; they include generalized fatigue (due to cytokine release), anorexia, malaise,\\nand weight loss (see\\nTable 27-2\\n). The liver is typically palpable and firm, with a blunt edge, but is sometimes small and difficult\\nto palpate.

Most (95%) cases\\noccur in women aged 35 to 70. PBC also clusters in families. A genetic predisposition, perhaps involving\\nthe X chromosome, probably contributes. There may be an inherited abnormality of immune regulation. An\\nautoimmune mechanism has been implicated; antibodies to antigens located on the inner mitochondrial\\nmembranes occur in > 95% of cases. These antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), the serologic hallmarks\\nof PBC, are not cytotoxic and are not involved in bile duct damage. PBC is associated with other\\nautoimmune disorders, such as RA, systemic sclerosis, Sjogren's syndrome, CREST syndrome,\\nautoimmune thyroiditis, and renal tubular acidosis.\\nT cells attack the small bile ducts. CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes directly target biliary epithelial cells. The\\ntrigger for the immunologic attack on bile ducts is unknown. Exposure to foreign antigens, such as an\\ninfectious (bacterial or viral) or toxic agent, may be the instigating event. These foreign antigens might be\\nstructurally similar to endogenous proteins (molecular mimicry); then the subsequent immunologic\\nreaction would be autoimmune and self-perpetuating. Destruction and loss of bile ducts lead to impaired\\nbile formation and secretion (cholestasis). Retained toxic materials such as bile acids then cause further\\ndamage, particularly to hepatocytes. Chronic cholestasis thus leads to liver cell inflammation and scarring\\nin the periportal areas. Eventually, hepatic inflammation decreases as hepatic fibrosis progresses to\\ncirrhosis.\\nAutoimmune cholangitis is sometimes considered to be a separate disorder. It is characterized by\\nautoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-smooth muscle antibodies, or both and has a\\nclinical course and response to treatment that are similar to PBC. However, in autoimmune cholangitis,\\nAMAs are absent.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAbout half of patients present without symptoms. Symptoms or signs may develop during any stage of the\\ndisease and may include fatigue or reflect cholestasis (and the resulting fat malabsorption, which may\\nlead to vitamin deficiencies and osteoporosis), hepatocellular dysfunction, or cirrhosis.\\nSymptoms usually develop insidiously. Pruritus, fatigue, and dry mouth and eyes are the initial symptoms\\nin > 50% of patients and can precede other symptoms by months or years. Other initial manifestations\\ninclude right upper quadrant discomfort (10%); an enlarged, firm, nontender liver (25%); splenomegaly\\n(15%); hyperpigmentation (25%); xanthelasmas (10%); and jaundice (10%).

Hepatitis\\nIntroduction\\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver characterized by diffuse or patchy necrosis. Major causes are\\nspecific hepatitis viruses, alcohol, and drugs. Less common causes include other viral infections (eg,\\ninfectious mononucleosis, yellow fever, cytomegalovirus infection) and leptospirosis. Parasitic infections\\n(eg, schistosomiasis, malaria, amebiasis), pyogenic infections, and abscesses that affect the liver are not\\nconsidered hepatitis. Liver \\ninvolvement with TB and other granulomatous infiltrations is sometimes called\\ngranulomatous hepatitis, but the clinical, biochemical, and histologic features differ from those of diffuse\\nhepatitis.\\nVarious systemic infections and other illnesses may produce small focal areas of hepatic inflammation or\\nnecrosis. This nonspecific reactive hepatitis can cause minor liver function abnormalities but is usually\\nasymptomatic.\\nSome types of infectious and noninfectious liver inflammation are summarized (see\\nTable 28-1\\n).\\nAcute Viral Hepatitis\\nAcute viral hepatitis is diffuse liver inflammation caused by specific hepatotropic viruses that\\nhave diverse modes of transmission and epidemiologies. A nonspecific viral prodrome is\\nfollowed by anorexia, nausea, and often fever or right upper quadrant pain. Jaundice often\\ndevelops, typically as other symptoms begin to resolve. Most cases resolve spontaneously, but\\nsome progress to chronic hepatitis. Occasionally, acute viral hepatitis progresses to acute\\nhepatic failure (fulminant hepatitis). Diagnosis is by liver function tests and serologic tests to\\nidentify the virus. Good hygiene can prevent acute viral hepatitis. Depending on the specific\\nvirus, preexposure and postexposure prophylaxis may be possible using vaccines or serum\\nglobulins. Treatment is usually supportive.\\n(See also Neonatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection on p. \\n2825\\n.)\\nAcute viral hepatitis is a common, worldwide disease that has different causes; each type shares clinical,\\nbiochemical, and morphologic features. Liver infections caused by nonhepatitis viruses (eg, Epstein-Barr\\nvirus, yellow fever virus, cytomegalovirus) generally are not termed acute viral hepatitis.\\nEtiology\\nAt least 5 specific viruses appear to be responsible (see\\nTable 28-2\\n). Other unidentified viruses probably also cause acute viral hepatitis.\\nHepatitis A virus (HAV):\\n HAV is a single-stranded RNA picornavirus. It is the most common cause of\\nacute viral hepatitis and is particularly common among children and young adults. In some countries, >\\n75% of adults have been exposed. HAV spreads primarily by fecal-oral contact and thus may occur in\\nareas of poor hygiene. Waterborne and food-borne epidemics occur, especially in underdeveloped\\ncountries. Eating contaminated raw shellfish is sometimes responsible. Sporadic cases are also common,\\nusually as a result of person-to-person contact. Fecal shedding of the virus occurs before symptoms\\ndevelop and usually ceases a few days after symptoms begin; thus, infectivity often has already ceased\\nwhen hepatitis becomes clinically evident. HAV has no known chronic carrier state and does not cause\\nchronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.\\nHepatitis B virus (HBV):\\n HBV is the most thoroughly characterized and complex hepatitis virus. The\\ninfective particle consists of a viral core plus an outer surface coat. The core contains circular double-\\nstranded DNA and DNA polymerase, and it replicates within the nuclei of infected hepatocytes. A surface\\ncoat is added in the cytoplasm and, for unknown reasons, is produced in great excess.\\nHBV is the 2nd most common cause of acute viral hepatitis. Prior unrecognized infection is common but is\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 28. Hepatitis\\n322'),\n",

HBV is often transmitted parenterally, typically by contaminated\\nblood or blood products. Routine screening of donor blood for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) has\\nnearly eliminated the previously common posttransfusion transmission, but transmission through needles\\nshared by drug users remains common. Risk of HBV is increased for patients in renal dialysis and\\noncology units and for hospital personnel in contact with blood. The virus may be spread through contact\\nwith other body fluids (eg, between sex partners, both heterosexual and homosexual; in closed\\ninstitutions, such as mental health institutions and prisons), but infectivity is far lower than that of HAV,\\nand the means of transmission is often unknown. The role of insect bites in transmission is unclear. Many\\ncases of acute hepatitis B occur sporadically without a known source.\\nHBV, for unknown reasons, is sometimes associated with several primarily extrahepatic disorders,\\nincluding polyarteritis nodosa, other connective tissue diseases, membranous glomerulonephritis, and\\nessential mixed cryoglobulinemia. The pathogenic role of HBV in these disorders is unclear, but\\nautoimmune mechanisms are suggested.\\nChronic HBV carriers provide a worldwide reservoir of infection. Prevalence varies widely according to\\nseveral factors, including geography (eg, < 0.5% in North America and northern Europe, > 10% in some\\nregions of the Far East). Vertical transmission from mother to infant is common (see p. \\n2644\\n).\\n[\\nTable 28-1.\\n Selected Diseases or Organisms Associated with Liver Inflammation]\\nHepatitis C virus (HCV):\\n HCV is a single-stranded RNA flavivirus. Six major HCV subtypes exist with\\nvarying amino acid sequences (genotypes); these subtypes vary geographically and in virulence and\\nresponse to therapy. HCV can also alter its amino acid pattern over time in an infected person, producing\\nquasispecies.\\nInfection is most commonly transmitted through blood, primarily when parenteral drug users share\\nneedles, but also through tattoos or body piercing. Sexual transmission and vertical transmission from\\nmother to infant are relatively rare. Transmission through blood transfusion has become very rare since\\nthe advent of screening tests for donated blood. Some sporadic cases occur in patients without apparent\\nrisk factors. HCV prevalence varies with geography and other risk factors.\\nHCV infection sometimes occurs simultaneously with specific systemic disorders, including essential\\nmixed cryoglobulinemia, porphyria cutanea tarda (about 60 to 80% of porphyria patients have HCV\\ninfection, but only a few patients infected with HCV develop porphyria), and glomerulonephritis; the\\nmechanisms are uncertain. In addition, up to 20% of patients with alcoholic liver disease harbor HCV. The\\nreasons for this high association are unclear because concomitant alcohol and drug use accounts for only\\na portion of cases. In these patients, HCV and alcohol act synergistically to exacerbate liver damage.\\nHepatitis D virus (HDV):\\n HDV, or delta agent, is a defective RNA virus that can replicate only in the\\npresence of HBV. It occurs uncommonly as a co-infection with acute hepatitis B or as a superinfection in\\nchronic \\nhepatitis B. Infected hepatocytes contain delta particles coated with HBsAg. Prevalence of HDV\\nvaries widely geographically, with endemic pockets in several countries. Parenteral drug users are at\\nrelatively high risk, but HDV (unlike HBV) has not widely permeated the homosexual community.\\nHepatitis E virus (HEV):\\n HEV is an enterically transmitted RNA virus. Outbreaks of acute HEV infection,\\noften waterborne and linked to fecal contamination of the water supply, have occurred in China, India,\\nMexico, Pakistan, Peru, Russia, and central and northern Africa. These outbreaks have epidemiologic\\ncharacteristics similar to HAV epidemics. Sporadic cases also occur. No outbreaks have occurred in the\\nUS or in Western Europe. Like HAV, HEV does not cause chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis, and there is no\\nchronic carrier state.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nGeneral:\\n Acute infection tends to develop in predictable phases. Infection begins with an incubation\\nperiod (see \\nTable 28-2\\n), during which the virus multiplies and spreads without symptoms.

Manifestations of portal-systemic encephalopathy, bleeding diathesis, or prolongation of INR\\nsuggest fulminant hepatitis (see p. \\n254\\n).\\nIf acute hepatitis is suspected, efforts are next directed toward identifying its cause. A history of exposure\\nmay provide the only clue of drug-induced or toxic hepatitis. The history should also elicit risk factors for\\nviral hepatitis. Prodromal sore throat and diffuse adenopathy suggest infectious mononucleosis rather\\nthan viral hepatitis. Alcoholic hepatitis is suggested by a history of drinking, more gradual onset of\\nsymptoms, and presence of vascular spiders or signs of chronic alcohol use or chronic liver disease (see\\nalso p. \\n235\\n); aminotransferase levels rarely exceed 300 IU/L, even in severe cases.

Many patients have no\\nhistory of acute hepatitis, and the first indication is discovery of asymptomatic\\naminotransferase elevations. Some patients present with cirrhosis or its complications (eg,\\nportal hypertension). Biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to grade and stage the\\ndisease. Treatment is directed toward complications and the underlying condition (eg,\\ncorticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis, antiviral therapy for viral hepatitis). Liver\\ntransplantation is often indicated for end-stage disease.\\nEtiology\\nHepatitis lasting > 6 mo is generally defined as chronic, although this duration is arbitrary. Hepatitis B\\nvirus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are frequent causes of chronic hepatitis; 5 to 10% of cases of\\nHBV infection, with or without hepatitis D virus (HDV) co-infection, and about 75% of cases of HCV\\ninfection become chronic. Hepatitis A and E viruses are not causes. Although the mechanism of chronicity\\nis uncertain, liver injury is mostly determined by the patient's immune reaction to the infection.\\nMany cases are idiopathic. A high proportion of idiopathic cases have prominent features of immune-\\nmediated hepatocellular injury (autoimmune hepatitis), including the following:\\n• The presence of serologic immune markers\\n• An association with histocompatibility haplotypes common in autoimmune disorders (eg, HLA-B1, HLA-\\nB8, HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4)\\n• A predominance of T lymphocytes and plasma cells in liver histologic lesions\\n• Complex in vitro defects in cellular immunity and immunoregulatory functions\\n• An association with other autoimmune disorders (eg, RA, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, proliferative\\nglomerulonephritis)\\n• A response to therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressants\\nSometimes chronic hepatitis has features of both autoimmune hepatitis and another chronic liver disorder\\n(eg, primary biliary cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis). These conditions are called overlap syndromes.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 28. Hepatitis\\n328\"),\n",

Sarcoidosis\\nis the most common noninfectious cause; the liver is involved in about two thirds of patients, and\\noccasionally, clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis are predominantly hepatic.\\nGranulomas are much less common in primary liver disorders; primary biliary cirrhosis is the only\\nimportant cause.

Gallbladder and Bile Duct Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe liver produces about 500 to 600 mL of bile each day. Bile is isosmotic with plasma and consists\\nprimarily of water and electrolytes but also organic compounds: bile salts, phospholipids (mostly lecithin),\\ncholesterol, bilirubin, and other endogenously produced or ingested compounds, such as proteins that\\nregulate GI function and drugs or their metabolites. Bilirubin is a degradation product of heme compounds\\nfrom worn-out RBCs and is the pigment that gives bile its yellow-green color.\\nBile salts (bile acids) are the major organic component in bile. The liver uses active transport to secrete\\nbile salts into the canaliculus, the cleft between adjacent hepatocytes. Canalicular transport is the rate-\\nlimiting step in bile formation. Once secreted, bile salts draw other bile components (particularly Na\\n+\\n and\\nwater) into the canaliculus by osmosis. Bile salts are also biologic detergents that enable the body to\\nexcrete cholesterol and potentially toxic compounds (eg, bilirubin, drug metabolites). The function of bile\\nsalts in the duodenum is to solubilize ingested fat and fat-soluble vitamins, facilitating their digestion and\\nabsorption. From the liver, bile flows from the intrahepatic collecting system into the right or left hepatic\\nduct, then into the common hepatic duct.\\nDuring fasting, about 75% of the bile secreted passes from the common hepatic duct into the gallbladder\\nvia the cystic duct. The rest flows directly into the common bile duct (formed by the junction of the\\ncommon hepatic and cystic ducts) into the duodenum. During fasting, the gallbladder absorbs up to 90%\\nof bile water, concentrating and storing bile.\\nBile empties from the gallbladder into the common bile duct. The common bile duct joins with the\\npancreatic duct to form the ampulla of Vater, which empties into the duodenum. Before joining the\\npancreatic duct, the common bile duct tapers to a diameter of ≤ 0.6 cm.\\nThe sphincter of Oddi, which surrounds both the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, includes a\\nsphincter for each duct. Bile does not normally flow retrograde into the pancreatic duct. These sphincters\\nare highly sensitive to cholecystokinin and other gut hormones (eg, gastrin-releasing peptide) and to\\nalterations in cholinergic tone (eg, by anticholinergic drugs).\\nEating releases gut hormones and stimulates cholinergic nerves, causing the gallbladder to contract and\\nthe sphincter of Oddi to relax. As a result, the gallbladder empties 50 to 75% of its contents into the\\nduodenum. Conversely, during fasting, an increase in sphincter tone facilitates gallbladder filling.\\nBile salts are poorly absorbed by passive diffusion in the proximal small bowel; most intestinal bile salts\\nreach the terminal ileum, which actively absorbs 90% into the portal venous circulation. Returned to the\\nliver, bile salts are efficiently extracted, promptly modified (eg, conjugated if they arrive in the free form),\\nand secreted back into bile. Bile salts circulate through this pathway from liver to gut to liver—the\\nenterohepatic circulation—10 to 12 times/day.\\nCholelithiasis\\nCholelithiasis is the presence of one or more calculi (gallstones) in the gallbladder. In\\ndeveloped countries, about 10% of adults and 20% of people > 65 yr have gallstones. Gallstones\\ntend to be asymptomatic. The most common symptom is biliary colic; gallstones do not cause\\ndyspepsia or fatty food intolerance. More serious complications include cholecystitis; biliary\\ntract obstruction (from stones in the bile ducts or choledocholithiasis), sometimes with infection\\n(cholangitis); and gallstone pancreatitis. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasonography. If\\ncholelithiasis causes symptoms or complications, cholecystectomy is necessary.\\nRisk factors for gallstones include female sex, obesity, increased age, American Indian ethnicity, a\\nWestern diet, and a family history. Most disorders of the biliary tract result from gallstones.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 31. Gallbladder & Bile Duct Disorders\\n348'),\n",

It consists of Ca bilirubinate (a polymer of bilirubin),\\ncholesterol microcrystals, and mucin. Sludge develops during gallbladder stasis, as occurs during\\npregnancy or use of TPN. Most sludge is asymptomatic and disappears when the primary condition\\nresolves. Alternatively, sludge can evolve into gallstones or migrate into the biliary tract, obstructing the\\nducts and leading to biliary colic, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.\\nThere are several types of gallstones.\\nCholesterol stones\\n account for > 85% of gallstones in the Western world. For cholesterol gallstones to\\nform, the following is required:\\n• Bile must be supersaturated with cholesterol. Normally, water-insoluble cholesterol is made water\\nsoluble by combining with bile salts and lecithin to form mixed micelles. Supersaturation of bile with\\ncholesterol most commonly results from excessive cholesterol secretion (as occurs in obesity or\\ndiabetes) but may result from a decrease in bile salt secretion (eg, in cystic fibrosis because of bile salt\\nmalabsorption) or in lecithin secretion (eg, in a rare genetic disorder that causes a form of progressive\\nintrahepatic familial cholestasis).\\n• The excess cholesterol must precipitate from solution as solid microcrystals. Such precipitation in the\\ngallbladder is accelerated by mucin, a glycoprotein, or other proteins in bile.\\n• The microcrystals must aggregate and grow. This process is facilitated by the binding effect of mucin\\nforming a scaffold and by retention of microcrystals in the gallbladder with impaired contractility due to\\nexcess cholesterol in bile.\\nBlack pigment stones\\n are small, hard gallstones composed of Ca bilirubinate and inorganic Ca salts\\n(eg, Ca carbonate, Ca phosphate). Factors that accelerate stone development include alcoholic liver\\ndisease, chronic hemolysis, and older age.\\nBrown pigment stones\\n are soft and greasy, consisting of bilirubinate and fatty acids (Ca palmitate or\\nstearate). They form during infection, inflammation, and parasitic infestation (eg, liver flukes in Asia).\\nGallstones grow at about 1 to 2 mm/yr, taking 5 to 20 yr before becoming large enough to cause\\nproblems. Most gallstones form within the gallbladder, but brown pigment stones form in the ducts.\\nGallstones may migrate to the bile duct after cholecystectomy or, particularly in the case of brown pigment\\nstones, develop behind strictures as a result of stasis and infection.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAbout 80% of people with gallstones are asymptomatic. The remainder have symptoms ranging from\\nbiliary-type pain (biliary colic) \\nto cholecystitis to life-threatening cholangitis. Biliary colic is the most\\ncommon symptom.\\nStones occasionally traverse the cystic duct without causing symptoms. However, most gallstone\\nmigration leads to cystic duct obstruction, which, even if transient, causes biliary colic. Biliary colic\\ncharacteristically begins in the right upper quadrant but may occur elsewhere in the abdomen. It is often\\npoorly localized, particularly in diabetics and the elderly. The pain may radiate into the back or down the\\narm. Episodes begin suddenly, become intense within 15 min to 1 h, remain at a steady intensity (not\\ncolicky) for up to 12 h (usually < 6 h), and then gradually disappear over 30 to 90 min, leaving a dull ache.\\nThe pain is usually severe enough to send patients to the emergency department for relief. Nausea and\\nsome vomiting are common, but fever and chills do not occur unless cholecystitis has developed. Mild\\nright upper quadrant or epigastric tenderness may be present; peritoneal findings are absent. Between\\nepisodes, patients feel well.\\nAlthough biliary-type pain can follow a heavy meal, fatty food is not a specific precipitating factor.\\nNonspecific GI symptoms, such as gas, bloating, and nausea, have been inaccurately ascribed to\\ngallbladder disease.

Abdominal ultrasonography is the method of choice\\nfor detecting gallbladder stones; sensitivity and specificity are 95%. Ultrasonography also accurately\\ndetects sludge. CT, MRI (see p. \\n230\\n), and oral cholecystography (rarely available now, although quite\\naccurate) are alternatives.

Laboratory tests usually are not helpful; typically, results are\\nnormal unless complications develop. Asymptomatic gallstones and biliary sludge are often detected\\nincidentally when imaging, usually ultrasonography, is done for other reasons. About 10 to 15% of\\ngallstones are calcified and visible on plain x-rays.\\nPrognosis\\nPatients with asymptomatic gallstones become symptomatic at a rate of about 2%/yr. The symptom that\\ndevelops most commonly is biliary colic rather than a major biliary complication. Once biliary symptoms\\nbegin, they are likely to recur; pain returns in 20 to 40% of patients/yr, and about 1 to 2% of patients/yr\\ndevelop complications such as cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, and gallstone pancreatitis.\\nTreatment\\n• Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic stones\\n• Expectant for asymptomatic stones; sometimes stone dissolution\\nMost asymptomatic patients decide that the discomfort, expense, and risk of elective surgery are not\\nworth removing an organ that may never cause clinical illness. However, if symptoms occur, gallbladder\\nremoval (cholecystectomy) is indicated because pain is likely to recur and serious complications can\\ndevelop.\\nSurgery:\\n Surgery can be done with an open or laparoscopic technique.\\nOpen cholecystectomy, which involves a large abdominal incision and direct exploration, is safe and\\neffective. Its overall mortality rate is about 0.1% when done electively during a period free of\\ncomplications.\\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice. Using video endoscopy and instrumentation\\nthrough small abdominal incisions, the procedure is less invasive than open cholecystectomy. The result\\nis a much shorter convalescence, decreased postoperative discomfort, improved cosmetic results, yet no\\nincrease in morbidity or mortality. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is converted to an open procedure in 2\\nto 5% of patients, usually because biliary anatomy cannot be identified or a complication cannot be\\nmanaged. Older age typically increases the risks of any type of surgery.\\nCholecystectomy effectively prevents future biliary colic but is less effective for preventing atypical\\nsymptoms such as dyspepsia. Cholecystectomy does not result in nutritional problems or a need for\\ndietary limitations. Some patients develop diarrhea, often because bile salt malabsorption in the ileum is\\nunmasked. Prophylactic cholecystectomy is \\nwarranted in asymptomatic patients with cholelithiasis only if\\nthey have large gallstones (> 3 cm) or a calcified gallbladder (porcelain gallbladder); these conditions\\nincrease the risk of gallbladder carcinoma.\\nStone dissolution:\\n For patients who decline surgery or who are at high surgical risk (eg, because of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 31.

Abdominal\\nultrasonography detects the gallstone and sometimes the associated inflammation. Treatment\\nusually involves antibiotics and cholecystectomy.\\nAcute cholecystitis is the most common complication of cholelithiasis. Conversely, ≥ 95% of patients with\\nacute cholecystitis have cholelithiasis. When a stone becomes impacted in the cystic duct and\\npersistently obstructs it, acute inflammation results. Bile stasis triggers release of inflammatory enzymes\\n(eg, phospholipase A, which converts lecithin to lysolecithin, which then may mediate inflammation). The\\ndamaged mucosa secretes more fluid into the gallbladder lumen than it absorbs. The resulting distention\\nfurther releases inflammatory mediators (eg, prostaglandins), worsening mucosal damage and causing\\nischemia, all of which perpetuate inflammation. Bacterial infection can supervene. The vicious circle of\\nfluid secretion and inflammation, when unchecked, leads to necrosis and perforation. If acute\\ninflammation resolves, the gallbladder becomes fibrotic and contracted and does not concentrate bile or\\nempty normally—features of chronic cholecystitis.\\nAcute acalculous cholecystitis:\\n Acalculous cholecystitis is cholecystitis without stones. It accounts for\\n5 to 10% of cholecystectomies done for acute cholecystitis. Risk factors include the following:\\n• Critical illness (eg, major surgery, burns, sepsis, or trauma)\\n• Prolonged fasting or TPN (both predispose to bile stasis)\\n• Shock\\n• Immune deficiency\\n• Vasculitis (eg, SLE, polyarteritis nodosa)\\nThe mechanism probably involves inflammatory mediators released because of ischemia, infection, or bile\\nstasis.

It refers to presumed gallbladder\\nsymptoms that continue or that develop after cholecystectomy or to other symptoms that result from\\ncholecystectomy. Removal of the gallbladder, the storage organ for bile, normally has few consequences\\non biliary tract function or pressures. In about 10%, biliary colic appears to result from functional or\\nstructural abnormalities of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in altered biliary pressures or heightened\\nsensitivity.\\nThe most common symptoms are dyspepsia or otherwise nonspecific symptoms rather than true biliary\\ncolic. Papillary stenosis, which is rare, is fibrotic narrowing around the sphincter, perhaps caused by\\ntrauma and inflammation due to pancreatitis, instrumentation (eg, ERCP), or prior passage of a stone.\\nOther causes include a retained bile duct stone, pancreatitis, and gastroesophageal reflux.\\nDiagnosis\\n• ERCP with biliary manometry or biliary nuclear scanning\\n• Exclusion of extrabiliary pain\\nPatients with postcholecystectomy pain should be evaluated as indicated for extra-biliary as well as biliary\\ncauses. If the pain suggests biliary colic, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, ALT, amylase, and lipase should\\nbe measured, and ERCP with biliary manometry or biliary nuclear scanning should be done. Elevated\\nliver enzymes suggest sphincter of Oddi dysfunction; elevated amylase and lipase suggest dysfunction of\\nthe sphincter's pancreatic portion.\\nDysfunction is best detected by biliary manometry done during ERCP, although ERCP has a risk of\\ninducing pancreatitis. Manometry shows increased pressure in the biliary tract when pain is reproduced. A\\nslowed hepatic hilum-duodenal transit time on a scan also suggests sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.\\nDiagnosis of papillary stenosis is based on a clear-cut history of recurrent episodes of biliary pain and\\nabnormal liver (or pancreatic) enzyme tests.\\nTreatment\\nEndoscopic sphincterotomy can relieve recurrent pain due to sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, especially if\\ndue to papillary stenosis.

These stones cause biliary colic, biliary obstruction,\\ngallstone pancreatitis, or cholangitis (bile duct infection and inflammation). Cholangitis, in turn,\\ncan lead to strictures, stasis, and choledocholithiasis. Diagnosis usually requires visualization\\nby magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography or ERCP.

About 5% of patients with ulcerative colitis and about 1% with Crohn's disease develop\\nPSC. This association and the presence of several autoantibodies (eg, anti-smooth muscle and\\nperinuclear antineutrophilic antibodies [pANCA]) suggest immune-mediated mechanisms. T cells appear\\nto be involved in the destruction of the bile ducts, implying disordered cellular immunity. A genetic\\npredisposition is suggested by a tendency for the disorder to develop in multiple family members and a\\nhigher frequency in people with HLAB8 and HLADR3, which are often correlated with autoimmune\\ndisorders. An unknown trigger (eg, bacterial infection, ischemic duct injury) probably causes PSC to\\ndevelop in genetically predisposed people.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nOnset is usually insidious, with progressive fatigue and then pruritus. Jaundice tends to develop later.\\nAbout 10 to 15% of patients present with repeated episodes of right upper quadrant pain and fever,\\npossibly due to ascending bacterial cholangitis. Steatorrhea and deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins can\\ndevelop. Persistent jaundice harbingers advanced disease. Symptomatic gallstones and\\ncholedocholithiasis tend to develop in about 75% of patients. Some patients, asymptomatic until late in\\nthe course, first present with hepatosplenomegaly or cirrhosis. PSC tends to slowly and inexorably\\nprogress. The terminal phase involves decompensated cirrhosis, portal hypertension, ascites, and liver\\nfailure. The time from diagnosis to liver failure is about 12 yr.\\nDespite the association between PSC and inflammatory bowel disease, the two diseases tend to run\\nseparate courses. Ulcerative colitis may appear years before PSC yet tends to have a milder course\\nwhen associated with PSC. Similarly, total colectomy does not change the course of PSC.

Arthritis\\nhas myriad possible causes, including infection, autoimmune disorders, crystal-induced inflammation, and\\nnoninflammatory tissue degeneration (eg, osteoarthritis). Arthritis may affect single joints (monarthritis) or\\nmultiple joints (polyarthritis) in a symmetric or asymmetric manner.

Many\\nsymptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, weight loss, Raynaud's syndrome, mucocutaneous symptoms\\n(eg, rash, eye irritation or pain, photosensitivity), and GI or cardiopulmonary symptoms, can be associated\\nwith various joint disorders.\\nPain is the most common symptom of joint disorders. The history should address the character, location,\\nseverity, factors that aggravate or relieve pain, and time frame (new-onset or recurrent). The clinician\\nmust determine whether pain is worse when first moving a joint or after prolonged use and whether it is\\npresent upon waking or develops during the day. Usually, pain originating from superficial structures is\\nbetter localized than pain originating from deeper structures. Pain originating in small distal joints tends to\\nbe better localized than pain originating in large proximal joints. Joint pain can be referred from extra-\\narticular structures or from other joints. Arthritis often causes aching pain, whereas neuropathies often\\ncause burning pain.\\nStiffness may mean weakness, fatigue, or fixed limitation of motion to patients. The clinician must\\nseparate the inability to move a joint from reluctance to move a joint because of pain. Characteristics of\\nstiffness may suggest a cause, as in the following:\\n• Discomfort that occurs with motion when attempting to move a joint after a period of rest occurs in\\nrheumatic disease. Duration of stiffness after beginning joint motion reflects its severity.\\n• The theater sign (stiffness upon standing that necessitates walking slowly after sitting for several hours)\\nis common in osteoarthritis.\\n• Stiffness is more severe and prolonged in inflammatory joint disorders.\\n• Morning stiffness in peripheral joints that lasts > 1 h can be an important early symptom of RA (see\\nTable 32-1\\n).\\n• In the low back, morning stiffness that lasts > 1 h may reflect spondylitis.\\nFatigue is a desire to rest that reflects exhaustion. It differs from weakness, inability to move, and\\nreluctance to move due to pain with movement.\\nInstability (buckling of a joint) may suggest weakness of the ligaments or other structures that stabilize the\\njoint, which are assessed by stress testing. Buckling occurs most often in the knee and most often results\\nfrom an internal joint derangement.\\nPhysical Examination\\nEach involved joint should be inspected and palpated, and the range of motion should be estimated. With\\npolyarticular disease, certain nonarticular signs (eg, fever, wasting, rash) may reflect systemic disorders.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 32.

Bony enlargement (often due to osteophytes) is\\nnoted.\\nActive range of motion (the maximum range through which the patient can move the joint) is measured\\nfirst, using a goniometer; limitation may reflect weakness, pain, or stiffness as well as mechanical\\nabnormalities.

Active and passive movement of an inflamed joint\\n(eg, due to infection or gout) may be very painful.\\nPatterns of joint involvement should be noted. Symmetric involvement of multiple joints is common in\\nsystemic diseases (eg, RA); monarticular (involving one joint) or asymmetric oligoarticular (involving ≤ 4)\\njoint involvement is more common in osteoarthritis and psoriatic arthritis. Small peripheral joints are\\ncommonly affected in RA, and the larger joints and spine are affected more in spondyloarthropathies.\\nHowever, a pattern of involvement may not be apparent in early disease.\\nCrepitus, a palpable or audible grinding produced by motion, is noted. It may be caused by roughened\\narticular cartilage or by tendons; crepitus-causing motions should be determined and may suggest which\\nstructures are involved.\\nSpecific features should be sought at each joint.\\nElbow:\\n Synovial swelling and thickening caused by joint disease occur in the lateral aspect between the\\nradial head and olecranon, causing a bulge.

The area around the joint is examined for swellings. Rheumatoid nodules are\\nfirm, occurring especially along the extensor surface of the forearm. Tophi are sometimes visible under\\nthe skin as cream-colored aggregates and indicate gout. Swelling of the olecranon bursa occurs over the\\ntip of the olecranon, is cystic, and does not limit joint motion; infection, trauma, gout, and RA are possible\\ncauses. Epitrochlear nodes occur above the medial epicondyle; they can result from inflammation in the\\nhand but can also suggest sarcoidosis or lymphoma.\\nShoulder:\\n Because pain can be referred to areas around the shoulder, shoulder palpation should include\\nthe glenohumeral, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints, the coracoid process, clavicle, acromion\\nprocess, subacromial bursa, biceps tendon, and greater and lesser tuberosities of the humerus, as well\\nas the neck. Glenohumeral joint effusions may cause a bulge between the coracoid process and the\\nhumeral head.

CT is useful if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. Ultrasonography,\\narthrography, and bone scanning may help in certain conditions, as can biopsy of bone, synovium, or\\nother tissues.\\nArthrocentesis:\\n Arthrocentesis is the process of puncturing the joint with a needle to withdraw fluid. If\\nthere is an effusion and arthrocentesis is done correctly, fluid can generally be withdrawn. Examination of\\nsynovial fluid is the most accurate way to exclude infection, diagnose crystal-induced arthritis, and\\notherwise determine the cause of joint effusions. It is indicated in all patients with severe or unexplained\\nmonarticular joint effusions and in patients with unexplained polyarticular effusions.\\nArthrocentesis is done using strictly sterile technique. Infection or other rash over the site used to enter\\nthe joint is a contraindication. Preparations for collecting samples should be made before doing the\\nprocedure. Local anesthesia, with lidocaine or difluoroethane spray, is often used. Many joints are\\npunctured on the extensor surface to avoid nerves, arteries, and veins, which are usually on the joint's\\nflexor surface. A 20-gauge needle can be used for most larger joints. Smaller joints of the upper and lower\\nextremities are probably easier to access using a 22- or 23-gage needle. As much fluid as is possible\\nshould be removed. Specific anatomic landmarks are used (see\\nFigs. 32-1\\n,\\n32-2\\n, and\\n32-3\\n).\\nMetacarpophalangeal joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, and interphalangeal joints of the hands and feet\\nare punctured similarly to each other, using a 22- or 23-gauge needle. The needle is inserted dorsally, to\\neither side of the extensor tendon. Distraction of the joint is sometimes useful to open the joint space and\\nallow easier access.\\n[\\nFig. 32-1.\\n Arthrocentesis of the shoulder.]\\nSynovial fluid examination:\\n At the bedside, gross characteristics of the fluid are assessed, such as its\\ncolor, turbidity, and viscosity. Viscosity can be assessed using the string sign. The length of a viscous\\nstring of joint fluid dropped from the syringe is normally > 3 cm. Inflammation decreases viscosity,\\nshortening the length of the string.\\nGross characteristics allow many effusions to be tentatively classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory,\\nor infectious (see\\nTable 32-2\\n). Effusions can also be hemorrhagic. Each type of effusion suggests certain joint diseases\\n(see\\nTable 32-3\\n). So-called noninflammatory effusions are actually mildly inflammatory but tend to suggest\\ndiseases such as osteoarthritis, in which inflammation is not severe.\\nLaboratory tests commonly done on joint fluid include cell count, leukocyte differential, Gram stain and\\nculture (if infection is a concern—see p. \\n365\\n), and wet drop examination for cells and crystals.

Autoimmune Rheumatic Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nAutoimmune rheumatic disorders include eosinophilic fasciitis, mixed connective tissue disease,\\npolymyositis and dermatomyositis, relapsing polychondritis, Sjogren's syndrome, SLE, and systemic\\nsclerosis. RA and the spondyloarthropathies and their variants (see \\nCh. 35\\n) are also immune mediated.\\nThe triggers and precise pathophysiology remain unknown for all these disorders, although many aspects\\nof pathogenesis are becoming clearer. Patients with most autoimmune rheumatic disorders are at\\nincreased risk of atherosclerosis.\\nEosinophilic Fasciitis\\nEosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is an uncommon disorder characterized by symmetric and painful\\ninflammation, swelling, and induration of the arms and legs. Diagnosis is by biopsy of skin and\\nfascia. Treatment is with corticosteroids.\\nThe cause of EF is unknown. The disorder occurs mostly in middle-aged men but can occur in women\\nand children.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe disease often begins after strenuous physical activity (eg, chopping wood). The initial features are\\npain, swelling, and inflammation \\nof the skin and subcutaneous tissues, followed by induration, creating a\\ncharacteristic orange-peel configuration most evident over the anterior surfaces of the extremities. The\\nface and trunk are occasionally involved. Restriction of arm and leg movement usually develops\\ninsidiously. Contractures commonly evolve, secondary to induration and thickening of the fascia, but the\\nprocess may also involve tendons, synovial membranes, and muscle. Typically, EF does not involve the\\nfingers and toes (acral areas). Muscle strength is unimpaired, but myalgia and arthritis may occur. Carpal\\ntunnel syndrome may also occur.\\nFatigue and weight loss are common. Rarely, aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphoproliferative\\nprocesses develop.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Biopsy\\nEF should be suspected in patients with typical symptoms. The cutaneous manifestations may suggest\\nsystemic sclerosis; however, patients with systemic sclerosis usually also have Raynaud's syndrome,\\nacral involvement, telangiectasia, and visceral changes (eg, esophageal dysmotility). All of these are\\nabsent in EF.\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by en bloc biopsy, which should be deep enough to include fascia and adjacent\\nmuscle fibers. Characteristic findings are inflammation of the fascia, with or without eosinophils.\\nBlood tests are not diagnostic, but CBC shows eosinophilia (in early active disease), and serum protein\\nelectrophoresis shows polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. CBC should be done in all patients because\\nthe presence of eosinophilia helps in the diagnosis. Autoantibodies are usually absent. MRI, although not\\nspecific, can show thickened fascia, the increased signal intensity in the superficial muscle fibers\\ncorrelating with the inflammation.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough the long-term outcome varies, EF is often self-limited and uncomplicated.\\nTreatment\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 33.

NSAIDs and H\\n2\\n blockers (eg, cimetidine) also have been used to treat EF.\\nMonitoring with CBCs is advised because of the occasional hematologic complications.\\nMixed Connective Tissue Disease\\nMixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is an uncommon, specifically defined, overlap\\nsyndrome characterized by clinical features of SLE, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis with\\nvery high titers of circulating antinuclear antibody to a ribonucleoprotein antigen. Hand\\nswelling, Raynaud's syndrome, polyarthralgia, inflammatory myopathy, esophageal\\nhypomotility, and pulmonary dysfunction are common. Diagnosis is by the combination of\\nclinical features, antibodies to ribonucleoprotein, and absence of antibodies specific for other\\nautoimmune diseases.

About 80% of\\npeople who have this disease are women. The cause is unknown. In some patients, the disorder evolves\\ninto classic systemic sclerosis or SLE.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nRaynaud's syndrome may precede other manifestations by years.

Skin findings include lupus or dermatomyositis-like rashes. Diffuse systemic sclerosis-like skin\\nchanges and ischemic necrosis or ulceration of the fingertips may occasionally develop.\\nAlmost all patients have polyarthralgias, and 75% have frank arthritis.

Renal biopsy is usually not necessary for\\ndiagnosis of SLE or to confirm renal involvement but is helpful in evaluating the status of renal disease\\n(ie, active inflammation vs postinflammatory scarring) and guide therapy.

Arthralgias are usually controlled with\\nNSAIDs. Antimalarials help, particularly when joint and skin manifestations are prominent.\\nHydroxychloroquine 200 mg po once/day or bid reduces the frequency of SLE flares. Alternatives include\\nchloroquine 250 mg po once/day and quinacrine 50 to 100 mg po once/day. Hydroxychloroquine can\\nrarely cause retinal toxicity. The eyes should be examined at 12-mo intervals.\\nSevere disease:\\n Corticosteroids are first-line therapy. A combination of prednisone and\\nimmunosuppressants is recommended in active, serious CNS lupus, vasculitis especially affecting viscera\\nor nerves, or active lupus nephritis. Prednisone is usually given in doses of 40 to 60 mg po once/day, but\\nthe dose may vary according to the manifestation of SLE. Oral azathioprine 1 to 2.5 mg/kg once/day or\\noral cyclophosphamide 1 to 4 mg/kg once/day can be used as an immunosuppressant. For renal\\ninvolvement, cyclophosphamide is usually given in intermittent IV pulses instead of daily oral doses; eg,\\nabout 500 mg to 1 g/m\\n2\\n IV (together with mesna and fluid loading to protect the bladder) monthly for 6 mo\\nand then once q 3 mo for 18 mo (less frequently if there is renal or hematologic toxicity—see\\nTable 33-2\\n).\\nIn CNS lupus or other critical crises, methylprednisolone 1 g by slow (1-h) IV infusion on 3 successive\\ndays is often the initial treatment, followed by IV cyclophosphamide, as mentioned previously.\\nMycophenolate mofetil is an alternative to cyclophosphamide therapy for patients with active kidney\\ndisease who have preserved kidney function. IgG 400 mg/kg IV once/day for 5 consecutive days may be\\nuseful for refractory thrombocytopenia. Patients\\n[\\nTable 33-2.\\n Protocol for Chemotherapy with Cyclophosphamide and IV Mesna]\\nwith end-stage renal disease can undergo kidney transplantation, as an alternative to dialysis, with a\\nsuccessful outcome, especially if their disease has been in remission.\\nImprovement of severe SLE often takes 4 to 12 wk. Thrombosis or embolism of cerebral, pulmonary, or\\nplacental vessels requires short-term treatment with heparin and longer treatment with warfarin, if the\\ndiagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is confirmed. The target INR is usually 3.\\nSuppressive therapy:\\n For most patients, the risk of flares can be decreased without prolonged high-\\ndose corticosteroids. Chronic disease should be treated with the lowest dose of corticosteroids and other\\ndrugs that control inflammation (eg, antimalarials, low-dose immunosuppressants). Treatment should be\\nguided by clinical features primarily, although anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers or serum\\ncomplement levels may be followed. Other pertinent blood and urine tests may be used to assess specific\\norgan involvement. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibody titers or serum complement levels may not parallel\\nnonrenal disease flares. If a patient needs long-term high-dose corticosteroids, alternative oral\\nimmunosuppressants should be considered. Ca, vitamin D, and bisphosphonate therapy should be\\nconsidered in patients taking corticosteroids long term.\\nFocal complications and coexisting medical conditions:\\n All patients should be closely monitored for\\natherosclerosis. Long-term anticoagulation is vital in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and\\nrecurrent thrombosis (see p. \\n2228\\n).\\nIf a pregnant patient has antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombotic complications can be limited with\\ncorticosteroids (prednisone ≤ 30 mg po once/day), low-dose aspirin, or anticoagulation with heparin.

Skin lesions begin as erythematous plaques and progress to atrophic scars. They cluster in\\nlight-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, scalp, and ears. Untreated, lesions extend and develop\\ncentral atrophy and scarring. There may be widespread scarring alopecia. Mucous membrane\\ninvolvement may be prominent, especially in the mouth.\\nPatients presenting with typical discoid lesions should be evaluated for SLE. Antibodies against double-\\nstranded DNA are almost invariably absent in DLE. Although it does not differentiate DLE from SLE,\\nbiopsy can rule out other disorders (eg, lymphoma or sarcoidosis). Biopsy should be done from the active\\nmargin of a skin lesion.\\nEarly treatment can prevent permanent atrophy. Exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be\\nminimized (eg, using potent sunscreens when outdoors). Topical corticosteroid ointments (particularly for\\ndry skin) or creams (less greasy than ointments) tid to qid (eg, triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 or 0.5%,\\nfluocinolone 0.025 or 0.2%, flurandrenolide 0.05%, betamethasone valerate 0.1%, and, particularly\\nbetamethasone dipropionate 0.05%) usually cause involution of small lesions; they should not be used\\nexcessively or on the face (where they cause skin atrophy).

In the extremities, chronic inflammation and fibrosis of the synovial membrane and surfaces\\nand periarticular soft tissues occur.\\nEsophageal motility becomes impaired, and the lower esophageal sphincter becomes incompetent;\\ngastroesophageal reflux and secondary strictures can develop. The intestinal muscularis mucosa\\ndegenerates, leading to pseudodiverticula in the colon and ileum. Interstitial and peribronchial fibrosis or\\nintimal hyperplasia of small pulmonary arteries can develop; if long-standing, pulmonary hypertension can\\nresult. Diffuse myocardial fibrosis or cardiac conduction abnormalities occur. Intimal hyperplasia of\\ninterlobular and arcuate arteries can develop within the kidneys, causing renal ischemia and\\nhypertension.\\nSSc varies in severity and progression, ranging from generalized skin thickening with rapidly progressive\\nand often fatal visceral involvement (SSc with diffuse scleroderma) to isolated skin involvement (often just\\nthe fingers and face) and slow progression (often several decades) before visceral disease develops.\\nThe latter form is termed limited cutaneous scleroderma or CREST syndrome (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud's\\nsyndrome, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias). In addition, SSc can overlap with other\\nautoimmune rheumatic disorders—eg, sclerodermatomyositis (tight skin and muscle weakness\\nindistinguishable from polymyositis) and mixed connective tissue disease.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe most common initial symptoms and signs are Raynaud's syndrome and insidious swelling of the\\ndistal extremities with gradual thickening of the skin of the fingers. Polyarthralgia is also prominent. GI\\ndisturbances (eg, heartburn, dysphagia) or respiratory complaints (eg, dyspnea) are occasionally the first\\nmanifestations.\\nSkin and nail manifestations:\\n Swelling of the skin is usually symmetric and progresses to induration. It\\nmay be confined to the fingers (sclerodactyly) and hands, or it may affect most or all of the body. The skin\\neventually becomes taut, shiny, and hypopigmented or hyperpigmented; the face becomes masklike; and\\ntelangiectases may appear on the fingers, chest, face, lips, and tongue. Subcutaneous calcifications may\\ndevelop, usually on the fingertips (pulps) and over bony eminences. Trophic ulcers are common,\\nespecially on the fingertips, overlying the finger joints, or over calcinotic nodules. Abnormal capillary and\\nmicrovascular loops in the nails can be seen with an ophthalmoscope or dissecting microscope.\\nJoint manifestations:\\n Polyarthralgias or mild arthritis can be prominent. Flexion contractures may\\ndevelop in the fingers, wrists, and elbows. Friction rubs may develop over the joints, tendon sheaths, and\\nlarge bursae.\\nGI manifestations:\\n Esophageal dysfunction is the most frequent visceral disturbance and occurs in most\\npatients. Dysphagia (usually retrosternal) usually develops first. Acid reflux can cause heartburn and\\nstricture. Barrett's esophagus occurs in one third of patients and predisposes to complications (eg,\\nstricture, adenocarcinoma). Hypomotility of the small bowel causes anaerobic bacterial overgrowth that\\ncan lead to malabsorption. Air may penetrate the damaged bowel wall and be visible on x-rays\\n(pneumatosis intestinalis). Leakage \\nof bowel contents into the peritoneal cavity can cause peritonitis.\\nDistinctive wide-mouthed diverticula can develop in the colon. Biliary cirrhosis may develop in patients\\nwith CREST syndrome.\\nCardiopulmonary manifestations:\\n Lung involvement generally progresses indolently, with substantial\\nindividual variability, but is a common cause of death. Lung fibrosis can impair gas exchange, leading to\\nexertional dyspnea and restrictive disease with eventual respiratory failure. Acute alveolitis (potentially\\nresponsive to therapy) can develop. Esophageal dysfunction can lead to aspiration pneumonia.\\nPulmonary hypertension may develop, as can heart failure, both of which are poor prognostic findings.\\nPericarditis with effusion or pleurisy can occur.

ANA are present in ≥ 90%, often with an\\nantinucleolar pattern. Antibody to centromeric protein (anticentromere antibody) occurs in the serum of a\\nhigh proportion of patients with CREST syndrome and is detectable on the ANA.

Vasculitis\\nIntroduction\\nVasculitis is inflammation of blood vessels, often with ischemia, necrosis, and occlusive changes. It can\\naffect any blood vessel—arteries, arterioles, veins, venules, or capillaries. Most damage results when\\ninflammation narrows vessels and causes tissue necrosis. Clinical manifestations of specific vasculitic\\ndisorders are diverse and depend on the size of the involved vessels and the organs affected by\\nischemia.\\nEtiology\\nVasculitis may be primary or secondary. Primary vasculitis results from an inflammatory response that\\ntargets the vessel walls and has no known cause. Secondary vasculitis may be triggered by an infection,\\na drug, or a toxin or may occur as part of another inflammatory disorder or cancer.\\nPathophysiology\\nHistologic description of an affected vessel should include the following:\\n• A description of vessel wall damage\\n• The nature of the inflammatory infiltrate in the vessel wall (eg, granulomatous, nongranulomatous,\\nleukocytoclastic vasculitis)\\n• A description of healing responses (eg, intimal hypertrophy, fibrosis)\\nCertain features (eg, predominant inflammatory cells, location of inflammation) suggest particular\\nvasculitic processes and may aid in the diagnosis (see\\nTable 34-1\\n). For example, in many acute lesions, the predominant inflammatory cells are PMNs; in chronic\\nlesions, lymphocytes predominate.\\nInflammation may be segmental or involve the entire vessel. At sites of inflammation, varying degrees of\\ncellular inflammation and necrosis or scarring occur in one or more layers\\n[\\nTable 34-1.\\n Histologic Clues to Diagnosis of Vasculitic Disorders]\\n[\\nTable 34-2.\\n Classification of Vasculitic Disorders]\\nof the vessel wall. Inflammation in the media of a muscular artery tends to destroy the internal elastic\\nlamina.\\nLeukocytoclastic vasculitis is a histopathologic term used to describe findings in small-vessel vasculitis. It\\nrefers to breakdown of inflammatory cells that leaves small nuclear fragments (nuclear debris) in and\\naround the vessels. Inflammation is transmural, rarely necrotizing, and nongranulomatous. PMNs\\npredominate early; later, lymphocytes predominate. Resolution of the inflammation tends to result in\\nfibrosis and intimal hypertrophy. Intimal hypertrophy or secondary clot formation can narrow the arterial\\nlumen and accounts for tissue ischemia or necrosis.\\nClassification\\nVasculitic disorders can be classified according to the size of the predominant vessel affected (see \\nTable\\n34-2\\n).

If patients cannot tolerate oral\\ncyclophosphamide, are unlikely to take oral drugs as directed, or have a high risk of bladder cancer, IV\\ncyclophosphamide may be used. The recommended cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide is 0.75 to 1\\ng/m\\n2\\n monthly. The dose should be reduced in patients with significant renal insufficiency. Patients\\ntaking cyclophosphamide should also be given prophylactic treatment against \\nPneumocystis jirovecii\\n.\\nAcrolein, a product of cyclophosphamide degradation, is toxic to the bladder epithelium and can lead to\\nhemorrhagic cystitis. For patients who have taken cyclophosphamide long term, risk of cystitis is\\nincreased, and some develop transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. During cyclophosphamide\\ntherapy, careful hydration is needed to reduce the risk of bladder hemorrhage, cystitis, and bladder\\ncancer. Mesna binds acrolein and is mixed together with the IV cyclophosphamide infusion. One milligram\\nof mesna is added for each milligram of cyclophosphamide. Recurrence of hematuria, especially without\\ncasts and dysmorphic red cells, should prompt a referral for urologic evaluation. Cystoscopy and renal\\nimaging should be done to exclude cancer.\\nRemission maintenance:\\n Corticosteroids are tapered to zero or to the lowest dose that can maintain\\nremission. Usually, methotrexate (with folate) or azathioprine is prescribed to replace cyclophosphamide\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 34. Vasculitis\\n393'),\n",

Common manifestations include recurrent oral ulcers, ocular\\ninflammation, genital ulcers, and skin lesions. The most serious manifestations are blindness,\\nneurologic or GI manifestations, venous thromboses, and arterial aneurysms. Diagnosis is\\nclinical, using international criteria. Treatment is mainly symptomatic but may involve\\ncorticosteroids for acute severe ocular or neurologic manifestations or immunosuppressants\\nfor severe chronic lesions.\\nBehcet's syndrome involves small and large arteries and veins. Arterial thrombosis and superficial and\\ndeep venous thrombosis often occur.\\nThe syndrome occurs nearly equally in men and women, typically beginning during their 20s.\\nOccasionally, the syndrome develops in children. Incidence varies by location. Behcet's syndrome is most\\ncommon along the silk route from the Mediterranean to China; it is uncommon in the US.\\nThe cause is unknown. Immunologic (including autoimmune) and viral or bacterial triggers have been\\nsuggested, and HLA-B51 is associated with cases from Turkey, Iran, China, Korea, and Japan.\\nNeutrophil infiltration is detected in biopsy specimens from oral aphthous ulcers and erythema nodosum\\nand pathergy lesions, but no histologic changes are pathognomonic.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMucocutaneous:\\n Almost all patients have recurrent painful oral ulcers resembling those of aphthous\\nstomatitis; in most, these ulcers are the first manifestations. The ulcers are round or oval, 2 to 10 mm in\\ndiameter, and shallow or deep with a central yellowish necrotic center; they can occur anywhere in the\\noral cavity, often in clusters. Ulcers last 1 to 2 wk. Similar ulcers occur on the penis and scrotum, on the\\nvulva where they are painful, or in the vagina where they may cause little or no pain.\\nCutaneous lesions are common and may include acneiform lesions, nodules, erythema nodosum,\\nsuperficial thrombophlebitis, pyoderma gangrenosum-type lesions, and palpable purpura.\\nPathergy (an erythematous papular or pustular response to local skin injury) is defined as a papule > 2\\nmm that appears 24 to 48 h after oblique insertion of a 20- to 25-gauge needle into the skin. Pathergy has\\noccurred in many parts of the world but is less common among North American and northern European\\npatients than among Middle Eastern and Asian patients.\\nOcular:\\n The eyes are affected in 25 to 75% of patients. The following may occur:\\n• Relapsing uveitis or iridocyclitis (most common) often manifests as pain, photophobia, and red eye.\\n• Hypopyon (a layer of pus visible in the anterior chamber) may occur.\\n• Uveitis is typically bilateral and episodic, often involves the entire uveal tract (panuveitis), and may not\\nresolve completely between episodes.\\n• Choroiditis, retinal vasculitis, vascular occlusion, and optic neuritis may irreversibly impair vision and\\neven progress to blindness.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 34.

It affects mainly middle-aged adults, and incidence increases\\nwith aging, peaking in people in their 50s.\\nEtiology\\nMost cases are idiopathic. About 20% of patients have hepatitis B or C.\\nThe cause is unknown, but immune mechanisms appear to be involved. The variety of clinical and\\npathologic features suggests multiple pathogenic mechanisms. Drugs may be a cause. Usually, no\\npredisposing antigen is identified. Patients with certain lymphomas and leukemias, RA, or Sjogren's\\nsyndrome may develop a systemic vasculitis similar to PAN.\\nPathophysiology\\nPAN is characterized by segmental, transmural necrotizing inflammation of muscular arteries, most\\ncommonly at points of bifurcation. Unlike other vasculitic disorders, PAN does not involve postcapillary\\nvenules or veins. Lesions in all stages of development and healing are usually present. Early lesions\\ncontain PMNs and occasionally eosinophils; later lesions contain lymphocytes and plasma cells.\\nGranulomatous inflammation does not occur. Intimal proliferation with secondary thrombosis and\\nocclusion leads to organ and tissue infarction. Weakening of the muscular arterial wall may cause small\\naneurysms and arterial dissection. Healing can result in nodular fibrosis of the adventitia.\\nMostly commonly affected are the kidneys, skin, peripheral nerves, joints, muscles, and GI tract. Often\\naffected are the liver and heart. Renal ischemia and infarction occur, but glomerulonephritis is not a\\nfeature of PAN. Purpura is not a characteristic of PAN.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPAN mimics many disorders.

The diagnosis is further clarified when clinical findings are combined with\\ncertain laboratory results and other causes are excluded. PAN is also suspected in patients with systemic\\nsymptoms or signs and peripheral (usually multiple) neuritis involving major nerve trunks (eg, radial,\\nperoneal, sciatic) in a bilaterally symmetric or asymmetric fashion (mononeuritis multiplex).\\nDiagnosis is confirmed by biopsy showing necrotizing arteritis or by arteriography showing the typical\\naneurysms in medium-sized arteries. Magnetic resonance angiography may show microaneurysms, but\\nsome abnormalities may be too small for it to detect. Thus, magnetic resonance angiography is not the\\ntest used primarily for diagnosis. Biopsy of clinically uninvolved tissue is usually useless because the\\ndisease is focal; biopsy should target sites suggested by clinical evaluation. Samples of subcutaneous\\ntissue, sural nerve, and muscle, if thought to be involved, are preferred to samples from the kidneys or\\nliver. If clinical findings are absent or minimal, electromyography and nerve conduction studies may help\\nselect the site of muscle or nerve biopsy. If skin lesions are present, surgical skin biopsies that include\\ndeeper dermis and subcutaneous fat should be done. (Punch biopsies of the skin that sample the\\nepidermis and superficial dermis miss the lesions of PAN.) Even though microscopic lesions in the testes\\nare common, testicular biopsy should not be done if testicular symptoms are absent and if other possible\\nsites are accessible because the yield is low.

It occurs predominantly in young women. Etiology is unknown. Vascular inflammation\\nmay cause arterial stenosis, occlusion, dilation, or aneurysms. It causes asymmetric pulses and\\nsymptoms and signs of arterial obstruction. Diagnosis is by aortic arteriography or magnetic\\nresonance angiography. Treatment is with corticosteroids and, for organ-threatening ischemia,\\nvascular interventions such as bypass surgery.\\nTakayasu's arteritis is rare.

In North America, annual incidence is estimated to be 2.6\\ncases/million.\\nEtiology\\nThe cause is unknown. Cell-mediated immune mechanisms may be involved and may be similar to those\\nin giant cell arteritis.\\nPathophysiology\\nTakayasu's arteritis affects primarily large elastic arteries. The most commonly affected are the\\ninnominate and subclavian arteries, aorta (mainly the ascending aorta and the arch), common carotid\\narteries, and renal arteries. Most patients have stenoses or occlusions. Aneurysms occur in about one\\nthird of patients. Usually, the wall of the aorta or its branches thickens irregularly, with intimal wrinkling.\\nWhen the aortic arch is affected, orifices of the major arteries emerging from the aorta may be markedly\\nnarrowed or even obliterated by intimal thickening. In one half of patients, pulmonary arteries are also\\naffected.\\nHistologically, early changes consist of adventitial mononuclear infiltrate with perivascular cuffing of the\\nvasa vasorum.

Joint Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nJoint disorders may be inflammatory (RA, spondyloarthropathies, crystal-induced arthritis) or relatively\\nless inflammatory (osteoarthritis, neurogenic arthropathy). Crystal-induced arthritis and infectious arthritis\\nare discussed elsewhere in THE MANUAL.\\nRheumatoid Arthritis\\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that primarily involves the\\njoints. RA causes damage mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteases.\\nCharacteristically, peripheral joints (eg, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints) are symmetrically\\ninflamed, leading to progressive destruction of articular structures, usually accompanied by\\nsystemic symptoms. Diagnosis is based on specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging features.\\nTreatment involves drugs, physical measures, and sometimes surgery. Disease-modifying\\nantirheumatic drugs help control symptoms and slow disease progression.\\nRA affects about 1% of the population. Women are affected 2 to 3 times more often than men. Onset may\\nbe at any age, most often between 35 yr and 50 yr, but can be during childhood (see \\nJuvenile Idiopathic\\nArthritis\\n on p. \\n339\\n) or old age.\\nEtiology\\nAlthough RA involves autoimmune reactions, the precise cause is unknown; many factors may contribute.\\nA genetic predisposition has been identified and, in white populations, localized to a shared epitope in the\\nHLA-DR \\nβ\\n1\\n locus of class II histocompatibility antigens. Unknown environmental factors (eg, viral\\ninfections) are thought to play a role.\\nPathophysiology\\nProminent immunologic abnormalities include immune complexes produced by synovial lining cells and in\\ninflamed blood vessels. Plasma cells produce antibodies (eg, rheumatoid factor [RF]) that contribute to\\nthese complexes, but destructive arthritis can occur in the absence of RF. Macrophages also migrate to\\ndiseased synovium in early disease; increased macrophage-derived lining cells are prominent along with\\nvessel inflammation. Lymphocytes that infiltrate the synovial tissue are primarily CD4+ T cells.\\nMacrophages and lymphocytes produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (eg, tumor necrosis\\nfactors [TNF], granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], various ILs, interferon-\\nγ\\n) in\\nthe synovium. Release of inflammatory mediators probably contributes to the systemic and joint\\nmanifestations of RA.\\nIn chronically affected joints, the normally thin synovium thickens and develops many villous folds. The\\nsynovial lining cells produce various materials, including collagenase and stromelysin, which contribute to\\ncartilage destruction, and IL-1 and TNF-\\nα\\n, which stimulate cartilage destruction, osteoclast-mediated\\nbone absorption, synovial inflammation, and prostaglandins (which potentiate inflammation). Fibrin\\ndeposition, fibrosis, and necrosis are also present. Hyperplastic synovial tissue (pannus) releases these\\ninflammatory mediators, which erode cartilage, subchondral bone, articular capsule, and ligaments. PMNs\\non average make up about 60% of WBCs in the synovial fluid.\\nRheumatoid nodules develop in about 30% of patients with RA. They are granulomas consisting of a\\ncentral necrotic area surrounded by palisaded histiocytic macrophages, all enveloped by lymphocytes,\\nplasma cells, and fibroblasts. Nodules and vasculitis can also develop in visceral organs.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nOnset is usually insidious, often beginning with systemic and joint symptoms. Systemic symptoms include\\nearly morning stiffness of affected joints, generalized afternoon fatigue and malaise, anorexia, generalized\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 35.

However, RF, often in\\nlow titers, occurs in patients with other diseases, including other connective tissue diseases (eg, SLE),\\ngranulomatous diseases, chronic infections (eg, viral hepatitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, TB), and\\ncancers. Low RF titers can also occur in 3% of the general population and 20% of the elderly. An RF titer\\nmeasured by latex agglutination of > 1:80 or a positive anti-CCP test supports the diagnosis of RA.\\nAnti-CCP antibodies have high specificity (90%) and sensitivity (96%) for RA and, like RF, predict a worse\\nprognosis.\\nX-rays show only soft-tissue swelling during the first months of disease. Subsequently, periarticular\\nosteoporosis, joint space (articular cartilage) narrowing, and marginal erosions may become visible.\\nErosions often develop within the first year but may occur any time. MRI seems to be more sensitive and\\ndetects earlier articular inflammation and erosions. In addition, abnormal subchondral bone signals (eg,\\nbone marrow lesions, bone marrow edema) around the knee suggest progressive disease.\\nIf RA is diagnosed, additional tests help detect complications and unexpected abnormalities. \\nCBC with\\ndifferential should be obtained. A normochromic (or slightly hypochromic)-normocytic anemia occurs in\\n80%; Hb is usually > 10 g/dL. If Hb is ≤ 10 g/dL, superimposed iron deficiency or other causes of anemia\\nshould be considered. Neutropenia occurs in 1 to 2% of cases, often with splenomegaly (Felty's\\nsyndrome). Acute-phase reactants (eg, thrombocytosis, elevated ESR, elevated C-reactive protein) reflect\\ndisease activity. A mild polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia often occurs. ESR is elevated in 90% of\\npatients with active disease.\\nSynovial fluid examination is necessary with any new-onset effusion to rule out other disorders and\\ndifferentiate RA from other inflammatory arthritides (eg, septic and crystal-induced arthritis). In RA, during\\nactive joint inflammation, synovial fluid is turbid, yellow, and sterile, with reduced viscosity and usually\\n10,000 to 50,000 WBCs/\\nμ\\nL; PMNs typically predominate, but > 50% may be lymphocytes and other\\nmononuclear cells. Crystals are absent.\\nDifferential diagnosis:\\n Many disorders can simulate RA:\\n• Crystal-induced arthritis\\n• Osteoarthritis\\n• SLE\\n• Sarcoidosis\\n• Reactive arthritis\\n• Psoriatic arthritis\\n• Ankylosing spondylitis\\nRF can be nonspecific and is often present in several autoimmune diseases; the presence of anti-CCP\\nantibodies is more specific for RA.\\nSome patients with crystal-induced arthritis may meet criteria for RA; however, synovial fluid examination\\nshould clarify the diagnosis. The presence of crystals makes RA unlikely. Joint involvement and\\nsubcutaneous nodules can result from gout, cholesterol, and amyloidosis as well as RA; aspiration or\\nbiopsy of the nodules may occasionally be needed.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 35.

Cold\\nmay be applied to reduce pain from temporary worsening in one joint. Orthopedic or athletic shoes with\\ngood heel and arch support are frequently helpful; metatarsal supports placed posteriorly to painful\\nmetatarsophalangeal joints decrease the pain of weight bearing. Molded shoes may be needed for\\nsevere deformities. Self-help devices enable many patients with debilitating RA to perform activities of\\ndaily living.\\nExercise should proceed as tolerated. During acute inflammation, passive range-of-motion exercise helps\\nprevent flexion contractures. Heat therapy can be helpful. Range-of-motion exercises done in warm water\\nare helpful because heat improves muscle function by reducing stiffness and muscle spasm. However,\\ncontractures can be prevented and muscle strength can be restored more successfully after inflammation\\nbegins to subside; active exercise (including walking and specific exercises for involved joints) to restore\\nmuscle mass and preserve range of joint motion should not be fatiguing. Flexion contractures may require\\nintensive exercise, casting, or immobilization (eg, splinting) in progressively more stretched-open\\npositions. Paraffin baths can warm digits and facilitate finger exercise. Massage by trained therapists,\\ntraction, and deep heat treatment with diathermy or ultrasonography may be useful.\\nSurgery:\\n Surgery must always be considered in terms of the total disease and patient expectations. For\\nexample, deformed hands and arms limit crutch use during rehabilitation; seriously affected knees and\\nfeet limit benefit from hip surgery. Reasonable objectives for each patient must be determined, and\\nfunction must be considered. Surgery may be done while the disease is active.\\nArthroplasty with prosthetic joint replacement is indicated if damage severely limits function; total hip and\\nknee replacements are most consistently successful. Prosthetic hips and knees cannot tolerate vigorous\\nactivity (eg, competitive athletics). Excision of subluxed painful metatarsophalangeal joints may greatly aid\\nwalking. Thumb fusions may provide stability for pinch. Neck fusion may be needed for C1-2 subluxation\\nwith severe pain or potential for spinal cord compression. Arthroscopic or open synovectomy can relieve\\njoint inflammation but only temporarily unless disease activity can be controlled.\\nDrugs for RA\\nThe goal is to reduce inflammation as a means of preventing erosions and progressive deformity.\\nDisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used early, often in combination. Other drug\\nclasses, including biologic agents, TNF-\\nα\\n antagonists, and IL-1 receptor antagonists, seem to slow the\\nprogression of RA. NSAIDs are of some help for the pain of RA but do not prevent erosions or disease\\nprogression. Sometimes low-dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone < 10 mg daily) are added to\\ncontrol severe polyarticular symptoms, usually with the objective of replacement with a DMARD. Intra-\\narticular depot corticosteroids can control severe monarticular or even oligoarticular symptoms. The\\noptimal combinations of drugs are not yet clear. However, some data suggest that certain combinations of\\ndrugs from different classes (eg, methotrexate plus other DMARDs, a rapidly tapered corticosteroid plus a\\nDMARD, methotrexate plus a TNF-\\nα\\n antagonist or an IL-1 receptor antagonist, a TNF-\\nα\\n antagonist or an\\nIL-1 receptor antagonist plus a DMARD) are more effective than using DMARDs alone sequentially or in\\ncombination.\\nNSAIDs:\\n Aspirin is no longer used for RA, as effective doses are often toxic. Only one NSAID should be\\ngiven at a time (see\\nTable 35-2\\n), although patients may also take aspirin at ≤ 325 mg/day for its antiplatelet cardioprotective\\neffect. Because the maximal response for NSAIDs can take up to 2 wk, doses should be increased no\\nmore frequently than this. Doses of drugs with flexible dosing can be increased until response is maximal\\nor maximum dosage is reached.

Other\\nprostaglandins are induced by inflammation and are produced by COX-2. Selective COX-2 inhibitors, also\\ncalled coxibs (eg, celecoxib), seem to have efficacy comparable to nonselective NSAIDs and are less\\nlikely to cause GI toxicity; however, they do not seem less likely to cause renal toxicity.\\nNSAIDs other than coxibs should be avoided in patients with previous peptic ulcer disease or dyspepsia.\\nOther possible adverse effects of all NSAIDs include headache, confusion and other CNS symptoms,\\nincreased BP, worsening of hypertension, edema, and decreased platelet function. The effect of NSAIDs\\non cardiovascular risk is still unclear. Creatinine levels can rise reversibly because of inhibited renal\\nprostaglandins; less frequently, interstitial nephritis can occur. Patients with urticaria, rhinitis, or asthma\\nfrom aspirin can have the same problems with these other NSAIDs.\\nTraditional DMARDs:\\n (See\\nTable 35-3\\n for specific dosage information and adverse effects of other drugs used to treat RA.)\\nThese drugs seem to slow the progression of RA and are indicated in nearly all patients with RA. They\\ndiffer from each other chemically and pharmacologically. Many take weeks or months to have an effect.\\nAbout two thirds of patients improve overall, but complete remissions are uncommon. Many result in\\nevidence of decreased damage on imaging studies, presumably reflecting decreased disease activity.\\nThey have minimal immediate analgesic effects, so NSAIDs or low-dose corticosteroids must often be\\ncontinued. Patients should be fully apprised of the risks of DMARDs and monitored carefully for evidence\\nof toxicity.\\nCombinations of DMARDs may be more effective than single drugs.

Also, combining a DMARD with another drug, such as methotrexate plus a TNF-\\nα\\n antagonist or\\nan IL-1 receptor antagonist or a rapidly tapered corticosteroid, may be more effective than using DMARDs\\nalone.\\nMethotrexate\\n is a folate antagonist with immunosuppressive effects at high dose. It is anti-inflammatory\\nat doses used in RA. It is very effective and has a relatively rapid onset (clinical benefit often within 3 to 4\\nwk). Methotrexate should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with hepatic dysfunction or renal\\nfailure. Alcohol should be avoided. Supplemental folate, 1 mg po once/day, reduces the likelihood of\\nadverse effects. CBC, AST, ALT, and albumin and creatinine levels should be determined about every 8\\nwk. Rarely, a liver biopsy is needed if liver function test findings are persistently twice the upper limit of\\nnormal or more and the patient needs to continue to use methotrexate. Severe relapses of arthritis can\\noccur after withdrawal of methotrexate. Paradoxically, rheumatoid nodules may enlarge with methotrexate\\ntherapy.\\nHydroxychloroquine\\n can also control symptoms of mild RA. Funduscopic examination should be done\\nand visual fields should be assessed before and every 12 mo during treatment. The drug should be\\nstopped if no improvement occurs after 9 mo.\\nSulfasalazine\\n can alleviate symptoms and slow development of joint damage. It is usually given as\\nenteric-coated tablets. Benefit should occur within 3 mo. Enteric coating or dose reduction may increase\\ntolerability. CBCs should be obtained after 1 to 2 wk and then about every 12 wk during therapy. AST and\\nALT should be obtained at about 6-mo intervals and whenever the dose is increased.\\nLeflunomide\\n interferes with an enzyme involved with pyrimidine metabolism.

Diagnosis is\\nclinical. Treatment involves NSAIDs and sometimes sulfasalazine or immunosuppressants.\\nSpondyloarthropathy associated with urethritis or cervicitis, conjunctivitis, and mucocutaneous lesions\\n(previously called Reiter's syndrome) is one type of reactive arthritis.\\nEtiology\\nTwo forms of reactive arthritis are common: sexually transmitted and dysenteric. The sexually transmitted\\nform occurs primarily in men aged 20 to 40. Genital infections with \\nChlamydia trachomatis\\n are most often\\nimplicated. Men or women can acquire the dysenteric form after enteric infections, primarily \\nShigella\\n,\\nSalmonella\\n, \\nYersinia\\n, or \\nCampylobacter\\n. Reactive arthritis probably results from joint infection or\\npostinfectious inflammation. Although there is evidence of microbial antigens in the synovium, organisms\\ncannot be cultured from joint fluid.\\nEpidemiology:\\n The prevalence of the HLA-B27 allele in patients is 63 to 96% vs 6 to 15% in healthy\\nwhite controls, thus supporting a genetic predisposition.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nReactive arthritis can range from transient monarticular arthritis to a severe, multisystem disorder.\\nConstitutional symptoms may include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Arthritis may be mild or severe. Joint\\ninvolvement is generally asymmetric and oligoarticular or polyarticular, occurring predominantly in the\\nlarge joints of the lower extremities and in the toes. Back pain may occur, usually with severe disease.\\nEnthesopathy (inflammation at tendinous insertion into bone—eg, plantar fasciitis, digital periostitis,\\nAchilles tendinitis) is common and characteristic. Mucocutaneous lesions—small, transient, relatively\\npainless, superficial ulcers—commonly occur on the oral mucosa, tongue, and glans penis (balanitis\\ncircinata). Particularly characteristic are vesicles (sometimes identical to pustular psoriasis) of the palms\\nand soles and around the nails that become hyperkeratotic and form crusts (keratoderma\\nblennorrhagicum). Rarely, cardiovascular complications (eg, aortitis, aortic insufficiency, cardiac\\nconduction defects), pleuritis, and CNS or peripheral nervous system symptoms develop.\\nUrethritis may develop 7 to 14 days after sexual contact (or occasionally after dysentery); low-grade fever,\\nconjunctivitis, and arthritis develop over the next few weeks. Not all features may occur, so incomplete\\nforms need to be considered. In men, the urethritis is less painful and productive of purulent discharge\\nthan acute gonococcal urethritis and may be associated with hemorrhagic cystitis or prostatitis.

Diagnosis is ultimately clinical and requires the typical peripheral arthritis with symptoms of GU\\nor GI infection or one of the other extra-articular features. Because these features may manifest at\\ndifferent times, definitive diagnosis may require several months. Serum and synovial fluid complement\\nlevels are high, but these findings are not usually diagnostic and need not be measured.\\nDisseminated gonococcal infection can closely simulate reactive arthritis (see p. \\n1472\\n). Arthrocentesis\\nmay fail to differentiate them, owing to inflammatory characteristics of synovial fluid in both disorders and\\nthe difficulty of culturing gonococci from this fluid. Clinical characteristics may help; disseminated\\ngonococcal infection tends to involve upper and lower extremities equally, be more migratory, and not\\nproduce back pain, and vesicles tend not to be hyperkeratotic. A positive gonococcal culture from blood\\nor skin lesions helps differentiate the two disorders, but a positive culture from the urethra or cervix does\\nnot. If differentiation is still difficult, ceftriaxone may be required for simultaneous diagnosis and treatment.\\nPsoriatic arthritis can simulate reactive arthritis, causing similar skin lesions, uveitis, and asymmetric\\narthritis. However, psoriatic arthritis often affects mostly the upper extremities and especially the distal\\ninterphalangeal joints, may be abrupt in onset but may also develop gradually, causes less enthesopathy,\\nand tends not to cause mouth ulcers or symptoms of GU or GI infection.\\nPrognosis\\nReactive arthritis often resolves in 3 to 4 mo, but up to 50% of patients experience recurrent or prolonged\\nsymptoms over several years. Joint, spinal, or sacroiliac inflammation or deformity may occur with chronic\\nor recurrent disease. Some patients are disabled.\\nTreatment\\n• NSAIDs\\n• Sometimes sulfasalazine, doxycycline, azathioprine or methotrexate, or a combination\\n• Supportive measures\\nNSAIDs (eg, indomethacin 25 to 50 mg po tid) usually help relieve symptoms.

Systemic\\ncorticosteroids have no proven value.\\nLocal injection of depot corticosteroids for enthesopathy or resistant oligoarthritis may relieve symptoms.\\nPhysical therapy aimed at maintaining joint mobility is helpful during the recovery phase. Anterior uveitis is\\ntreated as usual, with corticosteroid and mydriatic eye drops to prevent scarring. Conjunctivitis and\\nmucocutaneous lesions require only symptomatic treatment.\\nPsoriatic Arthritis\\nPsoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in people with psoriasis of the\\nskin or nails. The arthritis is often asymmetric, and some forms involve the distal\\ninterphalangeal joints. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is usually similar to that of RA but can\\nalso involve phototherapy.\\nPsoriatic arthritis develops in 5 to 40% of patients with psoriasis. Prevalence is increased in patients with\\nAIDS. Risk of some involvement is increased in patients with HLA-B27 or some other specific alleles and\\nin family members. Etiology and pathophysiology are unknown.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPsoriasis of the skin or nails may precede or follow joint involvement.

Only half of patients with pathologic changes of\\nOA have symptoms. Below age 40, most OA is in men and results from trauma. Women predominate from\\nage 40 to 70, after which men and women are equally affected.\\nClassification\\nOA is classified as primary (idiopathic) or secondary to some known cause.\\nPrimary OA may be localized to certain joints (eg, chondromalacia patellae is a mild OA that occurs in\\nyoung people). Primary OA is usually subdivided by the site of involvement (eg, hands and feet, knee,\\nhip). If primary OA involves multiple joints, it is classified as primary generalized OA.\\nSecondary OA results from conditions that change the microenvironment of the cartilage. These\\nconditions include significant trauma, congenital joint abnormalities, metabolic defects (eg,\\nhemochromatosis, Wilson's disease), infections (causing postinfectious arthritis), endocrine and\\nneuropathic diseases, and disorders that alter the normal structure and function of hyaline cartilage (eg,\\nRA, gout, chondrocalcinosis).\\nPathophysiology\\nNormal joints have little friction with movement and do not wear out with typical use, overuse, or trauma.\\nHyaline cartilage is avascular, aneural, and alymphatic. It is 95% water and extracellular cartilage matrix\\nand only 5% chondrocytes. Chondrocytes have the longest cell cycle in the body (similar to CNS and\\nmuscle cells). Cartilage health and function depend on compression and release of weight bearing and\\nuse (ie, compression pumps fluid from the cartilage into the joint \\nspace and into capillaries and venules,\\nwhereas release allows the cartilage to reexpand, hyperhydrate, and absorb necessary electrolytes and\\nnutrients).\\nOA begins with tissue damage from mechanical injury (eg, torn meniscus), transmission of inflammatory\\nmediators from the synovium into cartilage, or defects in cartilage metabolism. The tissue damage\\nstimulates chondrocytes to attempt repair, which increases production of proteoglycans and collagen.\\nHowever, efforts at repair also stimulate the enzymes that degrade cartilage, as well as inflammatory\\ncytokines, which are normally present in small amounts. Inflammatory mediators trigger an inflammatory\\ncycle that further stimulates the chondrocytes and synovial lining cells, eventually breaking down the\\ncartilage. Chondrocytes undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Once cartilage is destroyed,\\nexposed bone becomes eburnated and sclerotic.\\nAll articular and some periarticular tissues become involved in OA. Subchondral bone stiffens, then\\nundergoes infarction, and develops subchondral cysts. Attempts at bony repair cause subchondral\\nsclerosis and osteophytes at the joint margins. The osteophytes seem to develop in an attempt to\\nstabilize the joint. The synovium becomes inflamed and thickened and produces synovial fluid with less\\nviscosity and greater volume. Periarticular tendons and ligaments become stressed, resulting in tendinitis\\nand contractures. As the joint becomes less mobile, surrounding muscles thin and become less\\nsupportive. Menisci fissure and may fragment.\\nOA of the spine can, at the disk level, cause marked thickening and proliferation of the posterior\\nlongitudinal ligaments, which are posterior to the vertebral body but anterior to the spinal cord.

The\\nregular use of pillows under the knees while reclining encourages contractures and should also be\\navoided.

Increased blood flow to bone from reflex vasodilation, resulting in active bone resorption,\\ncontributes to bone and joint damage. Each new injury sustained by the joint causes more distortion as it\\nheals. Hemorrhagic joint effusions and multiple small fractures can occur, accelerating disease\\nprogression. Ligamentous laxity, muscular hypotonia, and rapid destruction of joint cartilage are common,\\npredisposing to joint dislocations, which also accelerate disease progression. Advanced neurogenic\\narthropathy can cause hypertrophic changes, destructive changes, or both.\\n[\\nTable 35-4.\\n Conditions Underlying Neurogenic Arthropathy]\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nArthropathy does not usually develop until years after onset of the neurologic condition but can then\\nprogress rapidly and lead to complete joint disorganization in a few months.

A prominent, often hemorrhagic, effusion and\\nsubluxation and instability of the joint are usually present during early stages. Acute joint dislocation\\nsometimes occurs also.\\nDuring later stages, pain may be more severe if the disease has caused rapid joint destruction (eg,\\nperiarticular fractures or tense hematomas). During advanced stages, the joint is swollen from bony\\novergrowth and massive synovial effusion.

Crystal-Induced Arthritides\\nIntroduction\\nArthritis can result from intra-articular deposition of crystals: monosodium urate, Ca pyrophosphate\\ndihydrate, basic Ca phosphate (apatite), and, rarely, others such as Ca oxalate crystals. Diagnosis\\nrequires synovial fluid analysis (see p. \\n287\\n). Polarized light microscopy is used to specifically identify\\nmost crystals; basic Ca phosphate crystals are of ultramicroscopic size and require other methods.\\nCrystals may be engulfed in WBCs or may be extracellular. The presence of crystals does not exclude the\\npossibility of simultaneous infectious or other inflammatory forms of arthritis.\\nGout\\nGout is precipitation of monosodium urate crystals into tissue, usually in and around joints,\\nmost often causing recurrent acute or chronic arthritis. Acute arthritis is initially monarticular\\nand often involves the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint. Symptoms include acute pain,\\ntenderness, warmth, redness, and swelling. Diagnosis requires identification of crystals in\\nsynovial fluid. Treatment of acute attacks is with anti-inflammatory drugs. The frequency of\\nattacks can be reduced by regular use of NSAIDs, colchicine, or both and by treating\\nhyperuricemia with allopurinol or uricosuric drugs.\\nGout is more common among men than women. Usually, gout develops during middle age in men and\\nafter menopause in women. Gout is rare in younger people but is often more severe in people who\\ndevelop the disorder before age 30. Gout often runs in families.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe greater the degree and duration of hyperuricemia, the greater is the likelihood of gout and the more\\nsevere are the symptoms. Urate levels can be elevated because of\\n• Decreased excretion\\n• Increased production\\n• Increased purine intake\\nWhy only some people with elevated serum uric acid (urate) levels develop gout is not known.\\nDecreased renal excretion\\n is by far the most common cause of hyperuricemia. It may be hereditary and\\nalso occurs in patients receiving diuretics and in those with diseases that decrease GFR. Ethanol\\nincreases purine catabolism in the liver and increases the formation of lactic acid, which blocks urate\\nsecretion by the renal tubules. Lead poisoning and cyclosporine, usually given to transplant patients,\\nirreversibly damage renal tubules, leading to urate retention.\\nIncreased production\\n of urate may be caused by increased nucleoprotein turnover in hematologic\\nconditions (eg, lymphoma, leukemia, hemolytic anemia) and in conditions with increased rates of cellular\\nproliferation and cell death (eg, psoriasis, cytotoxic cancer therapy, radiation therapy). Increased urate\\nproduction may also occur as a primary hereditary abnormality and in obesity, because urate production\\ncorrelates with body surface area. In most cases, the cause is unknown, but a few cases are attributable\\nto enzyme abnormalities; deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (complete\\ndeficiency is Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) is a possible cause, as is overactivity of\\nphosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase.\\nIncreased intake\\n of purine-rich foods (eg, liver, kidney, anchovies, asparagus, consomme, herring, meat\\ngravies and broths, mushrooms, mussels, sardines, sweetbreads) can contribute to hyperuricemia.\\nHowever, a strict low-purine diet lowers serum urate by only about 1 mg/dL.\\nUrate precipitates as needle-shaped monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, which are deposited\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 36.

At the acid pH of urine, urate precipitates readily as small\\nplatelike or irregular crystals that may aggregate to form gravel or stones, which may cause obstruction.\\nTophi are MSU crystal aggregates that most often develop in joint and cutaneous tissue.\\nAcute gouty arthritis may be triggered by trauma, medical stress (eg, pneumonia or other infection), and\\nespecially vascular occlusions (eg, stroke or MI), or by surgery, use of thiazide diuretics or drugs with\\nuricosuric activity (eg, allopurinol), or indulgence in purine-rich food or alcohol. Attacks are often\\nprecipitated by a sudden increase or, more commonly, a sudden decrease in serum urate levels. Why\\nacute attacks follow some of these precipitating conditions is unknown. Tophi in and around joints can\\nlimit motion and cause deformities, called chronic tophaceous gouty arthritis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute gouty arthritis usually begins with sudden onset of pain (often nocturnal). The metatarsophalangeal\\njoint of a great toe is most often involved (podagra), but the instep, ankle, knee, wrist, and elbow are also\\ncommon sites. Rarely, the hip, shoulder, sacroiliac, sternoclavicular, or cervical spine joints are involved.\\nThe pain becomes progressively more severe, usually over a few hours, and is often excruciating.\\nSwelling, warmth, redness, and exquisite tenderness may suggest infection. The overlying skin may\\nbecome tense, warm, shiny, and red or purplish. Fever, tachycardia, chills, and malaise sometimes occur.\\nCoexisting hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity are common.\\nCourse:\\n The first few attacks usually affect only a single joint and last only a few days. Later attacks may\\naffect several joints simultaneously or sequentially and persist up to 3 wk if untreated. Subsequent\\nattacks develop after progressively shorter symptom-free intervals. Eventually, several attacks may occur\\neach year.\\nTophi:\\n Tophi develop most often in patients with chronic gout, but they can occur in patients who have\\nnever had acute gouty arthritis. They are usually firm yellow or white papules or nodules, single or\\nmultiple. They can develop in \\nvarious locations, commonly the fingers, hands, feet, and around the\\nolecranon or Achilles tendon. Tophi can also develop in the kidneys and other organs and under the skin\\non the ears. Patients with osteoarthritic Heberden's nodes may develop tophi in the nodes. This\\ndevelopment occurs most often in elderly women taking diuretics. Normally painless, tophi, especially in\\nthe olecranon bursae, can become acutely inflamed and painful. Tophi may even erupt through the skin,\\ndischarging chalky masses of urate crystals. Tophi may eventually cause deformities.\\nChronic gout:\\n Chronic gouty arthritis can cause pain, deformity, and limited joint motion. Inflammation\\ncan be flaring in some joints while subsiding in others. About 20% of patients with gout develop\\nurolithiasis with uric acid stones or Ca oxalate stones. Complications include obstruction and infection,\\nwith secondary tubulointerstitial disease.

A typical recurrence in a patient with known gout does not\\nmandate arthrocentesis, but it should be done if there is any question of the diagnosis or if the patient's\\nrisk factors or any clinical characteristics suggest infectious arthritis. Synovial fluid analysis can confirm\\nthe diagnosis by identifying needle-shaped, strongly negatively birefringent urate crystals that are free in\\nthe fluid or engulfed by phagocytes. Synovial fluid during attacks has inflammatory characteristics (see\\nTable 36-1\\n), usually 2,000 to 100,000 WBCs/\\nμ\\nL, with > 80% polymorphonuclear WBCs.

However,\\nthe serum urate level reflects the size of the extracellular miscible urate pool. The level should be\\nmeasured on 2 or 3 occasions in patients with newly proven gout to establish a baseline; if elevated (> 7\\nmg/dL [> 0.41 mmol/L]), 24-h urinary urate excretion can also be measured. Normal 24-h excretion in\\npeople eating a regular diet is about 600 to 900 mg. Quantification of urinary uric acid can indicate\\nwhether hyperuricemia results from impaired excretion or increased production and help guide any serum\\nurate-lowering therapy. Patients with elevated urine excretion of urate are at increased risk of urolithiasis.\\nX-rays:\\n X-rays of the affected joint may be taken to look for bony tophi but are probably unnecessary if\\nthe diagnosis has been established by synovial fluid analysis.

However, they can still cause adverse effects, including GI upset, hyperkalemia, increases in\\ncreatinine, and fluid retention. Elderly and dehydrated patients are at particular risk, especially if there is\\na history of renal disease. Virtually any NSAID used in anti-inflammatory (high) doses is effective and is\\nlikely to exert an analgesic effect in a few hours (see\\nTable 35-2\\n on p. \\n336\\n). Treatment should be continued for several days after the pain and signs of\\ninflammation have resolved to prevent relapse.\\nOral colchicine\\n, a traditional therapy, often produces a dramatic response if begun soon after the onset\\nof symptoms. Joint pain generally begins to subside after 12 to 24 h of treatment and ceases within 3 to 7\\ndays. One regimen is colchicine 0.6 mg po q 1 h until symptoms abate to a maximum total dose of 4 to 5\\nmg or until diarrhea or vomiting occurs. However, diarrhea, sometimes severe, develops in up to 80% of\\npatients given this regimen of oral colchicine for an acute attack.

If\\ncolchicine is tolerated, 0.6 to 1.2 mg once/day can be continued as the attack subsides.\\nIV colchicine\\n is much less likely to cause GI symptoms and provides an alternative, particularly for\\npostoperative patients. Colchicine 1 mg is diluted with 0.9% saline to 20 mL and injected slowly (over 2 to\\n5 min); a second 1-mg dose can be given in 12 h if needed; no more than 2 mg is given in 24 h (and no\\nmore than 4 mg over 7 days). \\nIV colchicine should not be given to patients with renal or liver disease\\nor those receiving prophylactic \\noral colchicine, because severe bone marrow suppression, shock, and\\ndeath may occur.\\n IV colchicine is also locally irritating, particularly if extravasated. Although effective and\\nperhaps the option of choice in certain specific situations, IV colchicine should only be used with careful\\nadherence to prescribing indications and contraindications.\\nCorticosteroids\\n are sometimes used to treat acute attacks; however, this use is controversial because\\ninflammation may continue while symptoms are masked. Aspiration of affected joints, followed by\\ninstillation of corticosteroid ester crystal suspension, is very effective, particularly for monarticular\\nsymptoms; prednisolone tebutate 4 to 40 mg or prednisolone acetate 5 to 25 mg can be used, with dose\\ndepending on the size of the affected joint. Oral prednisone (about 40 mg once/day), IM or IV\\ncorticosteroids, or single-dose ACTH 80 U IM is also very effective, particularly if multiple joints are\\ninvolved. As with NSAID therapy, corticosteroids should be continued until after the attack fully resolves to\\nprevent relapse.\\nIn addition to NSAIDs or corticosteroids, supplementary analgesics, rest, ice application, and splinting of\\nthe inflamed joint may be helpful.

Such damage can be prevented and, if present, reversed with urate-\\nlowering drugs. Tophaceous deposits are resorbed by lowering serum urate. Lowering serum urate may\\nalso decrease the frequency of acute arthritic attacks. This decrease is accomplished by\\n• Blocking urate production with allopurinol\\n• Increasing urate excretion with a uricosuric drug\\n• Using both types of drugs together in severe tophaceous gout\\nUricase can also be given but is not yet routinely used. Uricase is an enzyme that converts urate to\\nallantoin, which is more soluble. IV uricase transiently lowers serum urate by a large amount.\\nHypouricemic therapy is indicated for patients with\\n• Tophaceous deposits\\n• Frequent or disabling attacks of gouty arthritis (eg, more than 2 attacks/yr or very severe attacks)\\ndespite prophylactic colchicine, an NSAID, or both\\n• Gout with persistent serum urate ≥ 9 mg/dL\\n• Urolithiasis\\n• Multiple comorbidities (eg, peptic ulcer disease, chronic kidney disease) that are relative\\ncontraindications to the drugs used to treat acute attacks (NSAIDs or corticosteroids)\\nHyperuricemia is not usually treated in the absence of gout.\\nIf the goal of hypouricemic therapy is to dissolve tophi, the serum urate level should be lowered to 4.5\\nmg/dL (0.26 mmol/L), the saturation level at the normal temperature (31° C) of the bunion joint, or even\\nlower. If tophi do not need to be dissolved, a level of 5 to 6 mg/dL (0.30 to 0.36 mmol/L), which is below\\nthe level of saturation (> 7.0 mg/dL [> 0.41 mmol/L] at normal core body temperature and pH), is\\nacceptable. These target levels should be maintained indefinitely. Low levels are often difficult to\\nmaintain.\\nDrugs are effective in lowering serum urate; dietary restriction of purines is less effective, but high intake\\nof high-purine food and alcohol (beer in particular) should be avoided. Carbohydrate restriction and\\nweight loss can lower serum urate in patients with insulin resistance because high insulin levels suppress\\nurate excretion. Because acute attacks tend to develop during the first months of hypouricemic therapy,\\nsuch therapy should be started in conjunction with once or twice daily colchicine or NSAIDs and during a\\nsymptom-free period. Resolution of tophi may take many months even with maintenance of serum urate\\nat low levels. Serum urate should be measured periodically, usually monthly while determining required\\ndrug dosage and then yearly to confirm the effectiveness of therapy.\\nAllopurinol\\n, which inhibits urate synthesis, is the most commonly prescribed hypouricemic therapy. It is\\nespecially helpful in treating patients who repeatedly pass uric acid or Ca oxalate stones or who have\\nsevere renal dysfunction. Uric acid stones or gravel \\nmay dissolve during allopurinol treatment.

Osteoporosis\\nIntroduction\\nOsteoporosis is a progressive metabolic bone disease that decreases bone density (bone mass\\nper unit volume), with deterioration of bone structure. Skeletal weakness leads to fractures with\\nminor or inapparent trauma, particularly in the thoracic and lumbar spine, wrist, and hip. Acute\\nor chronic back pain is common. Diagnosis is by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Prevention\\nand treatment involve Ca and vitamin D supplements, exercises to maximize bone and muscle\\nstrength and minimize the risk of falls, and drug therapy to preserve bone mass or stimulate\\nnew bone formation.\\nPathophysiology\\nNormally, bone formation and resorption are closely coupled. Osteoblasts (cells that make the organic\\nmatrix of bone and then mineralize bone) and osteoclasts (cells that resorb bone) are regulated by\\nparathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, estrogen, vitamin D, various cytokines, and other local factors\\nsuch as prostaglandins.\\nPeak bone mass in men and women occurs by the mid 20s. Blacks reach higher bone mass than whites\\nand Asians, whereas Hispanics have intermediate values. Men have higher bone mass than women.\\nBone mass plateaus for about 10 yr, during which time bone formation approximately equals bone\\nresorption. After this, bone loss occurs at a rate of about 0.3 to 0.5%/yr. Beginning with menopause, bone\\nloss accelerates in women to about 3 to 5%/yr for about 5 to 7 yr.\\nOsteoporotic bone loss affects cortical and trabecular (cancellous) bone. Cortical thickness and the\\nnumber and size of trabeculae decrease, resulting in increased porosity. Trabeculae may be disrupted or\\nentirely absent.\\nClassification\\nOsteoporosis can develop as a primary disorder or secondarily due to some other factor.\\nPrimary osteoporosis:\\n More than 95% of osteoporosis in women and probably about 80% in men is\\nprimary. Most cases occur in postmenopausal women and older men. The terms postmenopausal,\\ninvolutional, senile, and age-related osteoporosis have been used to describe primary osteoporosis in\\nelderly patients. Estrogen deficiency is an important factor in men as well as women. Other contributing\\nfactors may include decreased Ca intake, low vitamin D levels, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nThe major mechanism is increased bone resorption, which results in decreased bone mass and\\nmicroarchitectural deterioration, but other mechanisms also contribute not only in primary osteoporosis\\nbut also in the various secondary forms of osteoporosis. The mechanisms of bone loss may involve the\\nfollowing:\\n• Local changes in the production of bone-resorbing cytokines, such as increases in cytokines that\\nstimulate bone resorption\\n• Impaired formation response during bone remodeling (probably caused by age-related decline in the\\nnumber and activity of osteoblasts)\\n• Other factors such as a decline in local and systemic growth factors\\nTrabecular bone loss occurs more rapidly than cortical bone loss because trabecular bone is more porous\\nand bone turnover is high. However, loss of both types contributes to skeletal fragility.\\nThe most common sites for fragility fractures are the distal radius (dorsally displaced fractures), spine\\n(vertebral compression fractures), femoral neck, and greater trochanter. Other sites include the proximal\\nhumerus and pelvis. Fragility fractures rarely occur in children or young adults with normal gonadal\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 37. Osteoporosis\\n443'),\n",

This condition is called idiopathic osteoporosis.\\nSecondary osteoporosis:\\n Secondary osteoporosis accounts for < 5% of osteoporosis cases in women\\nbut probably more in men. The causes (see\\nTable 37-1\\n) may also aggravate bone loss and increase fracture risk in patients with primary\\nosteoporosis.\\nRisk Factors\\nBecause stress, including weight bearing, is necessary for bone growth, immobilization or extended\\nsedentary periods result in bone loss. Being thin predisposes to decreased bone mass. Insufficient\\ndietary intake of Ca, P, and vitamin D predisposes to bone loss, as does endogenous acidosis (eg, high-\\nprotein diets). Cigarette smoking and excessive caffeine or alcohol use also adversely affect bone mass.\\nWhites and Asians are at higher risk. A family history of osteoporosis also increases risk. Other risk\\nfactors (eg, decreasing\\n[\\nTable 37-1.\\n Causes of Secondary Osteoporosis]\\namounts of sex hormones) predispose to specific types of osteoporosis. Patients who have had one\\nfragility fracture are at increased risk of having other clinical (symptomatic) fractures as well as clinically\\nasymptomatic vertebral compression fractures.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost of the chronic pain typical of osteoporosis results from fractures, which may develop after minimal,\\ninapparent, or no trauma. Patients may be asymptomatic for years, until fractures begin to occur.\\nEventually, patients often develop pain in the bones or muscles, particularly of the back. Vertebral\\ncompression fractures are common, usually in weight-bearing vertebrae (T6 and below). The pain begins\\nacutely, usually does not radiate, is aggravated by weight bearing, may cause local tenderness, and\\ngenerally begins to subside in 1 wk. However, residual pain may last for months or be constant.\\nMultiple thoracic compression fractures eventually cause dorsal kyphosis, with exaggerated cervical\\nlordosis (dowager's hump). Abnormal stress on the spinal muscles and ligaments may cause chronic, dull,\\naching pain, particularly in the lower back. Fractures can develop at other sites, commonly the hip or\\nwrist, usually from falls.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)\\nOsteoporosis should be suspected in patients who sustain fractures after only mild or trivial trauma; older\\nadults, particularly those with risk factors and unexplained back pain; patients with decreased bone\\ndensity that is incidentally noted on imaging studies; and patients at risk of secondary osteoporosis. If\\nimaging studies have been done or are necessary to evaluate symptoms (eg, back pain), osteoporosis\\nmay be obvious. However, imaging studies are often equivocal, and the diagnosis should be established\\nby bone density measurement.\\nPlain x-rays:\\n Bones show decreased radiodensity and loss of trabecular structure, but not until about\\n30% of bone has been lost. A loss of horizontally oriented trabeculae increases the prominence of the\\ncortical end plates and of vertically oriented, weight-bearing trabeculae. Loss of height and increased\\nbiconcavity characterize vertebral compression fractures. Thoracic vertebral fractures may cause anterior\\nwedging. In long bones, although the cortices may be thin, the periosteal surface remains smooth.\\nVertebral fractures at T4 or above suggest cancer rather than osteoporosis.\\nCorticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is likely to cause rib fractures and exuberant callus formation at sites\\nof healing fractures. Osteomalacia may cause abnormalities on imaging tests similar to those of\\nosteoporosis (see \\nSidebar 37-1\\n).

Bone density of\\nthe lumbar spine, hip, distal radius or ulna, or the entire body can be measured. (Quantitative CT\\nscanning can produce similar measurements in the spine or hip.) Usually, the lumbar spine, total proximal\\nfemur, or femoral neck is measured. DEXA results are reported as T scores. A T score corresponds to the\\nnumber of standard deviations by which bone density differs from a healthy, young person of the same\\nsex and race.

However, monitoring the\\nresponse to treatment \\nwith serial measurements of bone density should be done only with central DEXA\\nscanning.\\nSidebar 37-1 Osteopenia: Differentiating Osteoporosis and Osteomalacia\\nOsteopenia is decreased bone mass. Two metabolic bone diseases decrease bone mass: osteoporosis\\nand osteomalacia. In osteoporosis, bone mass decreases, but the ratio of bone mineral to bone matrix is\\nnormal. In osteomalacia, the ratio of bone mineral to bone matrix is low.\\nOsteoporosis results from a combination of low peak bone mass, increased bone resorption, and\\nimpaired bone formation. Osteomalacia is due to impaired mineralization, usually because of severe\\nvitamin D deficiency or abnormal vitamin D metabolism (see p. \\n41\\n). Osteoporosis is much more common\\nthan osteomalacia in the US. The 2 disorders may coexist, and their clinical expression is similar;\\nmoreover, mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency can occur in osteoporosis.\\nCurrent central DEXA systems can also assess vertebral deformities in the lower thoracic and lumbar\\nspine, a procedure termed vertebral fracture analysis (VFA). Vertebral deformities, even those clinically\\nsilent, may indicate increased risk of future fractures. VFA is more likely to be useful in patients with loss\\nof ≥ 3 cm in height.\\nOther testing:\\n Once osteoporosis is diagnosed, patients should be checked for causes of secondary\\nosteoporosis. Serum Ca should be measured to rule out asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. PTH levels\\nmay be increased in patients with decreased Ca absorption or hypercalciuria. Other tests such as thyroid-\\nstimulating hormone or free thyroxine to check for hyperthyroidism, vitamin D levels, measurements of\\nurinary free cortisol, and blood counts and other tests to rule out cancer, especially myeloma (eg, serum\\nprotein electrophoresis), should be considered depending on the clinical findings. Serum alkaline\\nphosphatase is usually normal but may be elevated by recent fracture.\\nPatients with weight loss should be screened for GI disorders as well as cancer. Bone biopsy is reserved\\nfor unusual cases (eg, young patients with pathologic fractures and no apparent cause). Levels of serum\\nor urine N-telopeptide crosslinks (NTX) or free deoxypyridinoline (DPYR) may reflect increased\\nbreakdown of collagen. These tests are not sufficiently accurate for routine clinical use but may be used\\nto assess the effectiveness of therapy.\\nScreening\\nDEXA screening is recommended for all women > 65. Bone density should also be measured in women\\nbetween 50 and 65 who have risk factors, including a family history of osteoporosis, a history of fragility\\nfractures, and low body weight.

Diet alone is rarely adequate; Ca\\nsupplements are needed, most commonly as Ca carbonate or Ca citrate. Supplements differ in their\\nelemental Ca concentration.

By inhibiting bone resorption, bisphosphonates preserve\\nbone mass and can decrease vertebral and hip fractures by 50%. To treat osteoporosis, bisphosphonates\\ncan be given orally. Alendronate can be given at doses of 10 mg po once/day or 70 mg po once/wk,\\nibandronate 2.5 mg po once/day or 150 mg once/mo, or risedronate at 5 mg po once/day or 35 mg\\nonce/wk.

Oral\\nbisphosphonates must be taken on an empty stomach with a full glass of water, and the patient must\\nremain upright for ≥ 30 min. They can cause esophageal irritation. Esophageal disorders that delay transit\\ntime and symptoms of upper GI disorders are relative contraindications to oral bisphosphonates. Weekly\\nor monthly therapy is generally preferred for its greater convenience and probably fewer adverse effects.\\nParenteral zolendronate is an alternative to oral bisphosphonates.

Paget's Disease of Bone\\nIntroduction\\n(Osteitis Deformans)\\nPaget's disease of bone is a chronic disorder of the adult skeleton in which bone turnover is\\naccelerated in localized areas. Normal matrix is replaced with softened and enlarged bone. The\\ndisease may be asymptomatic or cause gradual onset of bone pain or deformity. Diagnosis is by\\nx-ray. Treatment includes symptomatic measures and often drugs, usually bisphosphonates.\\nAbout 1% of adults in the US > 40 have Paget's disease, with a 3:2 male predominance. Prevalence\\nincreases with aging. However, overall prevalence seems to be decreasing. The disease is most common\\nin Europe (except Scandinavia), Australia, and New Zealand. It is particularly common in England.\\nEtiology\\nSeveral genetic abnormalities, many affecting osteoclast generation and activity, have been identified.\\nMutations of the \\nSequestrum 1\\n gene from chromosome 6 are commonly related to Paget's disease.\\nAppearance of involved bone on electron microscopy suggests a viral infection, but a viral cause has not\\nbeen established.\\nPathophysiology\\nAny bone can be involved. The bones most commonly affected are, in decreasing order, the pelvis, femur,\\nskull, tibia, vertebrae, clavicle, and humerus.\\nBone turnover is accelerated at involved sites. Pagetic lesions are metabolically active and highly\\nvascular. Excessively active osteoclasts are often large and contain many nuclei. Osteoblastic repair is\\nalso hyperactive, causing coarsely woven, thickened lamellae and trabeculae. This abnormal structure\\nweakens the bone, despite bone enlargement and heavy calcification.\\nComplications:\\n Overgrown bone may compress nerves and other structures passing through small\\nforamina. Spinal stenosis or spinal cord compression may develop. Osteoarthritis may develop in joints\\nadjacent to involved bone.\\nIn about 10 to 15% of patients, increased bone formation and Ca requirement leads to secondary\\nhyperparathyroidism; if this need is not matched by an increase in Ca intake, hypocalcemia may occur.\\nHypercalcemia (see p. \\n843\\n) occasionally develops in patients who are immobile. It also occurs in patients\\nwith Paget's disease who develop secondary hyperparathyroidism.\\nLarge or numerous lesions may lead to high-output heart failure.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThere are usually no symptoms for a prolonged period. If symptoms occur, they develop insidiously, with\\npain, stiffness, fatigue, and bone deformity. Bone pain is aching, deep, and occasionally severe,\\nsometimes worse at night. Pain also may arise from compression neuropathy or osteoarthritis. If the skull\\nis involved, there may be headaches and hearing impairment.\\nSigns may include skull enlargement bitemporally and frontally (frontal bossing); dilated scalp veins;\\nnerve deafness in one or both ears; angioid streaks in the fundus of the eye; a short kyphotic trunk with\\nsimian \\nappearance; hobbling gait; and anterolateral angulation (bowing) of the thigh or leg, often with\\nwarmth and tenderness. Deformities may develop from bowing of the long bones or osteoarthritis.\\nPathologic fractures may be the presenting manifestation. Sarcomatous degeneration develops in < 1%\\nand is often suggested by increasingly severe pain.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 38.

Osteonecrosis\\nIntroduction\\n(Avascular Necrosis; Aseptic Necrosis; Ischemic Necrosis of Bone)\\nOsteonecrosis (ON) is a focal infarct of bone that may be caused by specific etiologic factors or\\nmay be idiopathic. It can cause pain, limitation of motion, joint collapse, and osteoarthritis.\\nDiagnosis is by x-rays and MRI. In early stages, surgical procedures may slow or prevent\\nprogression. In later stages, joint replacement may be required for relief of pain and\\nmaintenance of function.\\nIn the US, ON affects about 20,000 new patients annually. The hip (femoral head) is most commonly\\naffected, followed by the knee and shoulder (humeral head). The wrist and ankle are less often involved.\\nIt is unusual for ON to involve the shoulder or other less commonly affected sites without the hip also\\nbeing involved.\\nEtiology\\nThe most common cause of ON is trauma. Nontraumatic ON affects men more often than women, is\\nbilateral in > 60% of cases, and occurs primarily in patients between ages 30 and 50.\\nTraumatic ON:\\n The most common cause of traumatic ON is a displaced subcapital fracture of the hip\\n(see p. \\n3211\\n); ON is uncommon after intertrochanteric fractures. The incidence of ON after hip dislocation\\nis high without prompt reduction; the sooner reduction occurs, the lower the incidence. Fracture or\\ndislocation may cause ON by grossly disrupting or compressing nearby blood vessels.\\nSpontaneous ON of the knee (SPONK) is localized ON of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau in elderly\\nwomen (occasionally men). SPONK is thought to be caused by an insufficiency fracture (a type of fragility\\nfracture caused by normal wear and tear on osteoporotic bone that occurs without direct trauma).\\nNontraumatic ON:\\n Factors causing or contributing to nontraumatic ON are listed in\\nTable 39-1\\n. The most common factors are the following:\\n• Chronic corticosteroid use\\n• Excessive alcohol consumption\\nThe risk of ON is increased when the dose of prednisone or an equivalent corticosteroid is > 25 mg/day\\nfor several weeks or months, resulting in a cumulative dose usually > 3000 mg. The risk of ON also is\\nincreased when > 3 drinks/day (> 500 mL ethanol/wk) are consumed for several years. Some genetic\\nfactors increase susceptibility to ON. Subtle clotting abnormalities due to deficiencies in protein C, protein\\nS, or antithrombin III or to anticardiolipin antibodies (see \\nCh. 110\\n) can be detected in a high percentage of\\npatients with ON. Some disorders that are themselves associated with ON are treated with corticosteroids\\n(eg, SLE), so it is not clear whether risk is increased because of corticosteroid use or the disorder. About\\n20% of cases are idiopathic.\\n[\\nTable 39-1.\\n Nontraumatic Risk Factors for Osteonecrosis]\\nON of the jaw has recently been reported in several patients who have received high-dose IV\\nbisphosphonate therapy (see \\nSidebar 39-1\\n). Nontraumatic ON of the hip is bilateral in 60% of patients.\\nPathophysiology\\nON involves the death of osteocytes and bone marrow. Mechanisms of nontraumatic ON may include\\nembolization by blood clots or lipid droplets, intravascular thrombosis, and extravascular compression.\\nAfter the vascular insult, the repair processes attempt to remove necrotic bone and marrow and replace\\nthem with viable tissue.

However, in about 80% of patients, the process is not successful and the infarct\\ngradually collapses.

Usually pain then develops gradually, although it may be acute. With progressive collapse of the\\njoint, pain increases and is exacerbated by motion and weight bearing and is relieved by rest.\\nJoint-specific symptoms:\\n ON of the hip causes groin pain that may radiate down the thigh or into the\\nbuttock. Motion becomes limited, and a limp usually develops. SPONK usually causes sudden knee pain\\nwithout preceding trauma. This pain is most often on the medial side of the femoral condyle or tibial\\nplateau and manifests with tenderness, joint effusion, painful motion, and a limp. ON of the humeral head\\noften causes less pain and disability than hip and knee involvement. With advanced disease, patients\\nhave pain and decreased motion, although passive range of motion is less affected than active range of\\nmotion.\\nSidebar 39-1 Osteonecrosis of the Jaw\\nOsteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has no unanimously accepted definition but is generally held to be an\\noral lesion involving bare mandibular or maxillary bone, which usually manifests with pain and purulent\\ndischarge, although it may be asymptomatic. ONJ may occur spontaneously or after dental extraction or\\ntrauma, radiation therapy to the head and neck (osteoradionecrosis), or high-dose IV bisphosphonate\\ntherapy (eg, for cancer treatment). It is not clear whether routine use of oral bisphosphonates for\\ntreatment or prevention of osteoporosis increases risk of ONJ. Currently, otherwise appropriate\\nbisphosphonate use should not be discouraged. However, it seems reasonable to do any necessary oral\\nsurgery before beginning bisphosphonate therapy and to encourage good oral hygiene while patients are\\ntaking bisphosphonates.\\nOnce established, ONJ is challenging to treat and should be managed by an oral surgeon with\\nexperience treating ONJ. Treatment typically involves limited debridement, antibiotics, and oral rinses.\\nSurgical resection of the affected area may worsen the condition and should not be the initial treatment.\\nDiagnosis\\n• X-rays\\n• MRI\\nON should be suspected in patients with the following:\\n• Fractures associated with an increased incidence of ON, particularly if pain persists or worsens\\n• Persistent spontaneous hip, knee, or shoulder pain, particularly if risk factors for ON are present\\nPlain x-rays should be done initially.

Both hips should be imaged.

They have\\nbeen used most often in treating ON of the hip when the prognosis without treatment is worse than that\\nfor other regions. Core decompression is the procedure most frequently done; one or more cores of bone\\nare removed from the necrotic region or multiple small tracks or perforations are made in an attempt to\\ndecrease intraosseous pressure and stimulate repair. Core decompression is technically simple, and the\\ncomplication rate is very low if the procedure is done correctly. Protected weight bearing is needed for\\nabout 6 wk. Most reports indicate satisfactory or good results in 65% of patients, including those whose\\nhips have some degree of collapse, and in 80% of patients whose hips have small, early lesions. Other\\nestablished procedures include various proximal femoral osteotomies and bone grafting, both\\nvascularized and nonvascularized. These procedures are technically demanding, require protected\\nweight bearing for up to 6 mo, and have not been done often in the US. Reports vary as to their\\nindications and effectiveness. They should be done primarily at selected centers that have the surgical\\nexperience and facilities to achieve optimal results.

SRA,\\nwhich can be done instead of total hip replacement, involves the insertion of 2 metal caps, one into the\\nacetabulum and one onto the femoral head, producing a metal-on-metal articulation.

To prevent ON caused by\\ndecompression sickness, people should follow accepted rules for decompression when diving and when\\nworking in pressurized environments. Excessive alcohol use and smoking should be discouraged.

Bursa, Muscle, and Tendon Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nOften, muscles, bursae, and tendons are injured during sports activities. Injury, overuse, infection, and\\noccasionally disease can temporarily or permanently damage these structures. Damage can cause pain,\\nlimit control of movement, and reduce range of motion.\\nBursitis\\nBursitis is acute or chronic inflammation of a bursa. The cause is usually unknown, but trauma,\\nrepetitive or acute, may contribute, as may infection and crystal-induced disease. Symptoms\\ninclude pain (particularly with motion or pressure), swelling, and tenderness. Diagnosis is\\nusually clinical; however, ultrasonography may be needed to evaluate deep bursae. Diagnosis\\nof infection and crystal-induced disease requires analysis of bursal fluid. Treatment includes\\nsplinting, NSAIDs, sometimes corticosteroid injections, and treatment of the cause.\\nBursae are fluid-filled sac-like cavities or potential cavities that are located where friction occurs (eg,\\nwhere tendons or muscles pass over bony prominences). Bursae minimize friction between moving parts\\nand facilitate movement. Some communicate with joints.\\nBursitis may occur in the shoulder (subacromial or subdeltoid bursitis), particularly in patients with rotator\\ncuff tendinitis, which is usually the primary lesion in the shoulder. Other commonly affected bursae\\ninclude olecranon (miners' or barfly's elbow), prepatellar (housemaid's knee), suprapatellar,\\nretrocalcaneal, iliopectineal (iliopsoas), ischial (tailor's or weaver's bottom), greater trochanteric, pes\\nanserine, and first metatarsal head (bunion) bursae. Occasionally, bursitis causes inflammation in a\\ncommunicating joint.\\nEtiology\\nBursitis may be caused by the following:\\n• Injury\\n• Chronic overuse\\n• Inflammatory arthritis (eg, gout, RA)\\n• Acute or chronic infection (eg, pyogenic organisms, particularly \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n)\\nIdiopathic and traumatic causes are by far the most common. Acute bursitis may follow unusual exercise\\nor strain and usually causes bursal effusion. Infection most often affects olecranon and prepatellar\\nbursae.\\nChronic bursitis may develop after previous attacks of bursitis or repeated trauma. The bursal wall is\\nthickened, with proliferation of its synovial lining; bursal adhesions, villus formation, tags, and chalky\\ndeposits may develop.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute bursitis causes pain, particularly when the bursa is compressed or stretched during motion.\\nSwelling, sometimes with other signs of inflammation, is common if the bursa is superficial (eg,\\nprepatellar, olecranon). Swelling may be more prominent than pain in olecranon bursitis. Crystal- or\\nbacterial-induced bursitis is usually accompanied by erythema, pitting edema, pain, and warmth in the\\narea over the bursa.\\nChronic bursitis may last for several months and may recur frequently. Bouts may last a few days to\\nseveral weeks. If inflammation persists near a joint, the joint's range of motion may be limited.

Usually, bursitis can be diagnosed clinically. Ultrasonography or MRI can help confirm the\\ndiagnosis when deep bursae are not readily accessible for inspection, palpation, or aspiration. These\\ntests are done to confirm or exclude a suspected diagnosis. These imaging techniques increase the\\naccuracy of identifying the involved structures.\\nIf bursal swelling is particularly painful, red, or warm or if the olecranon or prepatellar bursa is affected,\\ninfection and crystal-induced disease should be excluded by bursal aspiration. After a local anesthetic is\\ninjected, fluid is withdrawn from the bursa using sterile techniques; analysis includes cell count, Gram\\nstain and culture, and microscopic search for crystals. Gram stain, although helpful, may not be specific,\\nand WBC counts in infected bursae are usually lower than those in septic joints. Urate crystals are easily\\nseen with polarized light, but the apatite crystals typical of calcific tendinitis appear only as shiny chunks\\nthat are not birefringent. X-rays should be taken if bursitis is persistent or if calcification is suspected.\\nAcute bursitis should be distinguished from hemorrhage into a bursa, which can cause similar\\nmanifestations because blood is inflammatory. Fluid in traumatic bursitis is serosanguineous. Cellulitis can\\ncause signs of inflammation but does not normally cause bursal effusion; cellulitis overlying the bursa is a\\nrelative contraindication to bursal puncture through the cellulitis, but if septic bursitis is strongly\\nsuspected, aspiration must occasionally be done.\\nTreatment\\n• Rest\\n• High-dose NSAIDs\\n• Treatment of crystal-induced disease or infection\\nCrystal-induced disease (see p. \\n349\\n) or infection should be treated if present. For infection, choice of\\nantibiotic is determined by results of Gram stain and culture. Empiric antibiotics effective against \\nS.\\naureus\\n should be given. Infectious bursitis requires drainage or excision in addition to antibiotics.\\nAcute nonseptic bursitis is treated with temporary rest or immobilization and high-dose NSAIDs and\\nsometimes with other analgesics. Voluntary movement should be increased as pain subsides. Pendulum\\nexercises are helpful for the shoulder joint.\\nIf oral drugs and rest are inadequate, aspiration and intrabursal injection of depot corticosteroids 0.5 to 1\\nmL (eg, triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg/mL) are the treatment of choice. About 1 mL of local anesthetic\\n(eg, 2% lidocaine) can be injected before the corticosteroid injection. The same needle is used; it is kept\\nin place and the syringes are changed. Dose and volume of the corticosteroid may vary according to the\\nsize of the bursa. Infrequently, a flare-up occurs within several hours of injection of a depot corticosteroid;\\nthe flare-up is probably a form of crystal-induced synovitis. It usually lasts ≤ 24 h and responds to cold\\ncompresses plus analgesics. Oral corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) can be used if a local injection is not\\nfeasible.\\nChronic bursitis is treated the same as acute bursitis, except that splinting and rest are less likely to help\\nand range-of-motion exercises are especially important.

Treatment includes rest, NSAIDs, and sometimes corticosteroid injections.\\nTendinopathy usually results from repeated small tears or degenerative changes (sometimes with Ca\\ndeposit) that occur over years in the tendon.\\nTendinitis and tenosynovitis most commonly affect tendons associated with the shoulder (rotator cuff), the\\ntendon of the long head of the biceps muscle (bicipital tendon), flexor carpi radialis or ulnaris, flexor\\ndigitorum (for infectious flexor tenosynovitis, see p. \\n390\\n), popliteus tendon, Achilles tendon (see p. \\n3304\\n),\\nand the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis, which share a common fibrous sheath (the\\nresulting disorder is de Quervain's syndrome—see p. \\n393\\n).\\nEtiology\\nThe cause of tendinitis is often unknown. It usually occurs in people who are middle-aged or older as the\\nvascularity of tendons decreases; repetitive microtrauma may contribute. Repeated or extreme trauma\\n(short of rupture), strain, and excessive or unaccustomed exercise probably also contribute. Some\\nquinolone antibiotics may increase the risk of tendinopathy and tendon rupture.\\nRisk of tendinitis may be increased by certain systemic disorders—most commonly RA, systemic\\nsclerosis, gout, reactive arthritis, and diabetes or, very rarely, amyloidosis or markedly elevated blood\\ncholesterol levels. In younger adults, particularly women, disseminated gonococcal infection may cause\\nacute migratory tenosynovitis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAffected tendons are usually painful when moved. Occasionally, tendon sheaths become swollen and fluid\\naccumulates, usually when patients have infection, RA, or gout. Swelling may be visible or only palpable.\\nAlong the tendon, palpation elicits localized tenderness of varying severity.\\nIn systemic sclerosis, the tendon sheath may remain dry, but movement of the tendon in its sheath causes\\nfriction, which can be felt, or heard with a stethoscope.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Sometimes imaging\\nUsually, the diagnosis can be based on symptoms and physical examination, including palpation or\\nspecific maneuvers to assess pain. MRI or ultrasonography may be done to confirm the diagnosis or rule\\nout other disorders. MRI can detect tendon tears and inflammation (as can ultrasonography).\\n• \\nRotator cuff tendinitis:\\n This disorder is the most common cause of shoulder pain. Active abduction in\\nan arc of 40 to 120° and internal rotation cause pain (see p. \\n3298\\n). Passive abduction causes less\\npain. Ca deposits in the tendon just below the acromion are sometimes visible on x-ray.\\nUltrasonography or MRI may help with further evaluation and with treatment decisions.\\n• \\nBicipital tendinitis:\\n Pain in the biceps tendon is aggravated by shoulder flexion or resisted supination\\nof the forearm. Examiners can elicit tenderness proximally over the bicipital groove of the humerus by\\nrolling (flipping) the bicipital tendon under their thumb.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 41.

In patients with trochanteric bursitis, palpation over the lateral prominence of the greater\\ntrochanter elicits tenderness. Patients often have a history of chronic pressure on the joint, trauma, a\\nchange in gait (eg, due to osteoarthritis, stroke, or leg-length discrepancy), or inflammation at this site\\n(eg, in RA).\\nTreatment\\n• Rest or immobilization, heat or cold, followed by exercise\\n• High-dose NSAIDs\\n• Sometimes corticosteroid injection\\nSymptoms are relieved by rest or immobilization (splint or sling) of the tendon, application of heat (usually\\nfor chronic inflammation) or cold (usually for acute inflammation), and high-dose NSAIDs (see\\nTable 35-2\\n on p. \\n336\\n) for 7 to 10 days. Indomethacin or colchicine may be helpful if gout is the cause (see\\np. \\n349\\n). After inflammation is controlled, exercises that gradually increase range of motion should be done\\nseveral times a day, especially for the shoulder, which can develop contractures rapidly.\\nInjecting a sustained-release corticosteroid (eg, betamethasone 6 mg/mL, triamcinolone 40 mg/mL,\\nmethylprednisolone 20 to 40 mg/mL) in the tendon sheath may help; injection is usually indicated if pain is\\nsevere or if the problem has been chronic. Injection volume may range from 0.3 mL to 1 mL, depending\\non the site. An injection through the same needle of an equal or double volume of local anesthetic (eg, 1\\nto 2% lidocaine) confirms the diagnosis if pain is relieved immediately. Clinicians should be careful not to\\ninject the tendon (which can be recognized by marked resistance to injection); doing so may weaken it,\\nincreasing risk of rupture. Patients are advised to rest the injected joint to reduce the slight risk of rupture.\\nInfrequently, symptoms can worsen for up to 24 h after the injection.\\nRepeat injections and symptomatic treatment may be required.

Neck and Back Pain\\nIntroduction\\nNeck pain and back pain are among the most common reasons for physician visits. This discussion\\ncovers neck pain involving the posterior neck (not pain limited to the anterior neck) and does not cover\\nmost major traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, dislocations, subluxations).\\nPathophysiology\\nDepending on the cause, neck or back pain may be accompanied by neurologic symptoms.\\nIf a nerve root is affected, pain may radiate distally along the distribution of that root (called radicular pain\\nor, in the low back, sciatica). Strength, sensation, and reflexes of the area innervated by that root may be\\nimpaired.\\nIf the spinal cord is affected, strength, sensation, and reflexes may be impaired at the affected spinal cord\\nlevel and all levels below (called segmental neurologic deficits).\\nIf the cauda equina is affected, segmental deficits develop in the lumbosacral region, typically with loss of\\nbowel and bladder function, loss of perianal sensation, erectile dysfunction, urinary retention, and loss of\\nrectal tone and sphincter (eg, bulbocavernosus, anal wink) reflexes.\\nAny painful disorder of the spine may also cause reflex tightening (spasm) of paraspinal muscles, which\\ncan be excruciating.\\nEtiology\\nMost neck and back pain is caused by disorders of the spine. Fibromyalgia is also a common cause.\\nOccasionally, pain is referred from extraspinal disorders (particularly vascular, GI, or GU disorders). Some\\nuncommon causes—spinal and extraspinal—are serious.\\nMost spinal disorders are mechanical.

It usually results from compression of nerve roots in the\\nlower back. Common causes include intervertebral disk herniation, osteophytes, and narrowing\\nof the spinal canal (spinal stenosis). Symptoms include pain radiating from the buttocks down\\nthe leg. Diagnosis sometimes involves MRI or CT. Electromyography and nerve conduction\\nstudies can identify the affected level. Treatment includes symptomatic measures and\\nsometimes surgery, particularly if there is a neurologic deficit.\\nEtiology\\nSciatica is typically caused by nerve root compression, usually due to intervertebral disk herniation (see\\np. \\n1810\\n), bony irregularities (eg, osteoarthritic osteophytes, spondylolisthesis), or, much less often,\\nintraspinal tumor or abscess. Compression may occur within the spinal canal or intervertebral foramen.\\nThe nerves can also be compressed outside the vertebral column, in the pelvis or buttocks. L5-S1, L4-L5,\\nand L3-L4 nerve roots are most often affected (see\\nTable 186-1\\n on p. \\n1805\\n).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPain radiates along the course of the sciatic nerve, most often down the buttocks and posterior aspect of\\nthe leg to below the knee. The pain is typically burning, lancinating, or stabbing. It may occur with or\\nwithout low back pain. The Valsalva maneuver or coughing may worsen pain due to disk herniation.\\nPatients may complain of numbness and sometimes weakness in the affected leg.\\nNerve root compression can cause sensory, motor, or, the most objective finding, reflex deficits see p.\\n1810\\n). L5-S1 disk herniation may affect the ankle jerk reflex; L3-L4 herniation may affect the knee jerk.\\nStraight leg raising may cause pain that radiates down the leg when the leg is raised above 60° and\\nsometimes less. This finding is sensitive for sciatica; pain radiating down the affected leg when the\\ncontralateral leg is lifted (crossed straight leg raising) is more specific for sciatica.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Sometimes MRI, electrodiagnostic studies, or both\\nSciatica is suspected based on the characteristic pain. If it is suspected, strength, reflexes, and sensation\\nshould be tested. If there are neurologic deficits or if symptoms persist for > 6 wk, imaging and\\nelectrodiagnostic studies should be done. Structural abnormalities causing sciatica (including spinal\\nstenosis) are most accurately diagnosed by MRI or CT. Electrodiagnostic studies can confirm the\\npresence and degree of nerve root compression and can exclude conditions that may mimic sciatica,\\nsuch as polyneuropathy. These studies may help determine whether the lesion involves single or multiple\\nnerve levels and whether the clinical findings correlate with MRI abnormalities (especially valuable before\\nsurgery).

Hand Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nCommon hand disorders include a variety of deformities, ganglia, infections, Kienbock's disease, nerve\\ncompression syndromes, noninfectious tenosynovitis, and osteoarthritis. Complex regional pain syndrome\\n(reflex sympathetic dystrophy) is discussed on p. \\n1633\\n, and hand injuries are discussed in \\nCh. 323\\n.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory and physical examination findings are often diagnostic in hand disorders.\\nHistory:\\n The history should include information about the trauma or other events that may be associated\\nwith symptoms. The presence and duration of deformity and difficulty with motion are noted. The\\npresence, duration, severity, and factors that exacerbate or relieve pain are elicited. Associated\\nsymptoms, such as fever, swelling, rashes, Raynaud's syndrome (see p. \\n2221\\n), paresthesias, and\\nweakness, are also recorded.\\nPhysical examination:\\n Examination should include inspection for redness, swelling, or deformity and\\npalpation for tenderness. Active \\nrange of motion should be tested for any possible tendon injury. Passive\\nrange of motion can assess whether specific motions aggravate pain. Sensation is tested most accurately\\nby 2-point discrimination, using 2 ends of a paper clip. Motor function testing involves muscles innervated\\nby the radial, median, and ulnar nerves. Vascular examination should include evaluation of capillary refill,\\nradial and ulnar pulses, and Allen's test (see p. \\n1856\\n). Stress testing is helpful when specific ligament\\ninjuries are suspected (eg, ulnar collateral ligament in gamekeeper's thumb—see p. \\n3216\\n). Provocative\\ntesting can aid in the diagnosis of tenosynovitis and nerve compression syndromes.\\nLaboratory testing:\\n Laboratory testing has a limited role. Plain x-rays and MRI are helpful for injuries,\\narthritis, and Kienbock's disease or to rule out hidden foreign bodies that could be sources of infections.\\nNerve conduction testing can help diagnose nerve compression syndromes. Bone scans may assist in\\ndiagnosing occult fractures and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.\\nDeformities\\nDeformities can result from generalized disorders (eg, arthritis) or dislocations, fractures, and other\\nlocalized disorders. Most nontraumatic localized disorders can be diagnosed by physical examination.\\nOnce a hand deformity becomes firmly established, it cannot be significantly altered by splinting, exercise,\\nor other nonsurgical treatment.\\nMallet Finger\\nMallet finger is a flexion deformity of the distal interphalangeal joint preventing extension (see\\nFig. 43-1\\n).\\nThis deformity results from an extensor tendon rupture or an avulsion fracture of the distal phalanx. The\\ndeformity may not be obvious immediately after injury, but on examination, patients cannot fully extend the\\ndistal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Closed injuries may be treated with splinting that holds the DIP joint in\\nextension and leaves the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint free. Avulsion fractures are usually united\\nafter 6 wk, but pure tendon injuries require an additional 2 to 4 wk of nighttime splinting. Surgery may be\\nrequired if there is a fracture that involves a large proportion of the articular surface or if the joint is\\nsubluxated.\\nSwan-Neck Deformity\\nA swan-neck deformity consists of hyperextension of the PIP joint, flexion of the DIP joint, and\\nsometimes flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joint (see\\nFig. 43-2\\n).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 43.

The\\ninability to correct or compensate for hyperextension of the PIP joint makes finger closure impossible and\\ncan cause severe disability. Treatment is aimed at correcting the underlying disorder when possible (eg,\\ncorrecting the mallet finger or any bony malalignment, releasing spastic intrinsic muscles). Mild\\ndeformities in patients with RA may be treated with a functional ring splint.\\nTrue swan-neck deformity does not affect the thumb, which has only one interphalangeal\\n[\\nFig. 43-1.\\n Mallet finger.]\\n[\\nFig. 43-2.\\n Boutonniere and swan-neck deformities.]\\njoint. However, severe hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint of the thumb with flexion of the\\nmetacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint can occur; this is called a duck bill, Z (zigzag) type, or 90°-angle\\ndeformity. With simultaneous thumb instability, pinch is greatly impaired. This deformity can usually be\\ncorrected by interphalangeal arthrodesis along with tendon reconstruction at the MCP joint.\\nBoutonniere Deformity\\n(Buttonhole Deformity)\\nA boutonniere deformity consists of flexion of the PIP joint accompanied by hyperextension of\\nthe DIP joint (see \\nFig. 43-2\\n).\\nThis deformity can result from tendon laceration, dislocation, fracture, osteoarthritis, or RA. Classically,\\nthe deformity is caused by disruption of the central slip attachment of the extensor tendon to the base of\\nthe middle phalanx, allowing the proximal phalanx to protrude (\"buttonhole\") between the lateral bands of\\nthe extensor tendon. Initial treatment consists of splinting, but it must occur before scarring and fixed\\ndeformities develop. Surgical reconstruction often cannot restore normal motion but may decrease the\\ndeformity and improve hand function.\\nDupuytren\\'s Contracture\\n(Palmar Fibromatosis)\\nDupuytren\\'s contracture is progressive contracture of the palmar fascial bands, causing flexion\\ndeformities of the fingers.\\nDupuytren\\'s contracture is one of the more common hand deformities; the incidence is higher among men\\nand increases after age 45. This autosomal dominant condition with variable penetrance may occur more\\ncommonly among patients with diabetes, alcoholism, or epilepsy. However, the specific factor that causes\\nthe palmar fascia to thicken and contract is unknown.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe earliest manifestation is usually a tender nodule in the palm, most often near the middle or ring finger;\\nit gradually becomes painless.

Excision of the diseased fascia must\\nbe meticulous because it surrounds neurovascular bundles and tendons. Incomplete excision or new\\ndisease results in recurrent contracture, especially in patients who are young at disease onset or who\\nhave a family history, Garrod's pads, Peyronie's disease, or plantar foot involvement. Injectable\\ncollagenase may reverse some contractures, although this treatment is not yet in widespread clinical use.\\nGanglia\\n(Ganglion Cysts)\\nGanglia are cystic swellings occurring usually on the hands, especially on the dorsal aspect of\\nthe wrists. Aspiration or excision is indicated for symptomatic ganglia.\\nGanglia constitute about 60% of chronic soft-tissue swellings affecting the hand and wrist. They usually\\ndevelop spontaneously in adults aged 20 to 50, with a female:male preponderance of 3:1.\\nEtiology\\nThe cause of most ganglia is unknown. The cystic structures are near or attached (often by a pedicle) to\\ntendon sheaths and joint capsules. The wall of the ganglion is smooth, fibrous, and of variable thickness.\\nThe cyst is filled with clear gelatinous, sticky, or mucoid fluid of high viscosity. The fluid in the cyst is\\nsometimes almost pure hyaluronic acid.\\nMost ganglia are isolated abnormalities. The dorsal wrist ganglion arises from the scapholunate joint and\\nconstitutes about 65% of ganglia of the wrist and hand. The volar wrist ganglion arises over the distal\\naspect of the radius and constitutes about 20 to 25% of ganglia. Flexor tendon sheath ganglia and\\nmucous cysts (arising from dorsal distal interphalangeal joint) make up the remaining 10 to 15%. Ganglia\\nmay spontaneously regress.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Examination\\nGanglia are evident on examination. Another type of ganglion on the dorsal wrist occurs in patients with\\nRA; it is easily differentiated by its soft irregular appearance and association with proliferative rheumatoid\\nextensor tenosynovitis.\\nTreatment\\n• Aspiration or excision if troublesome\\nMost ganglia do not require treatment. However, if the patient is disturbed by its appearance or if the\\nganglion is painful or tender, a single aspiration with a large-bore needle is effective in about 50% of\\npatients. Attempting to rupture the ganglion by hitting it with a hard object risks local injury without likely\\nbenefit.

Foot and Ankle Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nMost foot problems result from anatomic disorders or abnormal function of articular or extra-articular\\nstructures (see\\nFig. 44-1\\n). Less commonly, foot problems reflect a systemic disorder (see\\nTable 44-1\\n).\\nIn people with diabetes and people with peripheral vascular disease, careful examination of the feet, with\\nevaluation of vascular sufficiency and neurologic integrity, should be done at least twice/yr. People with\\nthese diseases should examine their own feet at least once/day.\\nThe feet are also common sites for corns and calluses (see p. \\n660\\n) and infections by fungus (see \\nTinea\\nPedis\\n on p. \\n708\\n), bacteria (see p. \\n694\\n), and viruses (see \\nWarts\\n on p. \\n715\\n).\\nTable 44-2\\n lists foot and ankle disorders according to anatomic site.\\nTable 44-3\\n lists common causes of heel pain according to location.\\nTibialis Posterior Tendinosis\\nTibialis posterior tendinosis, degeneration of the tibialis posterior tendon, is the most common\\ncause of pain behind the medial malleolus.\\nThe posterior tibial tendon lies immediately behind the medial malleolus. Degeneration results from long-\\nstanding biomechanical problems, such as excessive pronation often in obese people. The tendon can\\nalso be involved by primary inflammatory disorders, such as RA or gout.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nEarly on, patients experience occasional pain behind the medial malleolus. Over time, the pain becomes\\nsevere, with painful swelling behind the medial malleolus. Normal standing, walking, and standing on the\\ntoes become difficult.\\n[\\nFig. 44-1.\\n Bones of the foot.]\\n[\\nTable 44-1.\\n Foot Manifestations of Systemic Disorders]\\nDiagnosis\\n• MRI\\nClinical findings suggest the diagnosis. Palpation of the tendon in an inverted-plantar flexed position\\nusually elicits pain. Standing on the toes is usually painful and may not be possible if the tendon is\\nruptured. Pain and swelling behind the medial malleolus, especially with tibialis posterior tendon pain on\\n[\\nTable 44-2.\\n Common Foot and Ankle Disorders by Anatomic Site]\\npalpation, are highly suggestive. MRI or ultrasonography can confirm injury to the tendon and its extent.\\nTreatment\\n• Orthotics and braces or surgery\\nComplete rupture requires surgery if normal function is the goal.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome refers to compression of the nerve within\\nthis canal, but the term has been loosely applied to neuralgia of the posterior tibial nerve resulting from\\nany cause. Synovitis of the flexor tendons of the ankle caused by abnormal foot function, inflammatory\\narthritis (eg, RA), fracture, and ankle venous stasis edema are contributing factors. Patients with\\nhypothyroidism may develop tarsal tunnel-like symptoms as a result of perineural mucin deposition.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPain (occasionally burning and tingling) is usually retromalleolar and sometimes in the plantar medial heel\\nand may extend along the plantar surface as far as the toes. Although the pain is worse during standing\\nand walking, pain at rest may occur as the disorder progresses.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Examination and electrodiagnostic testing\\nTapping or palpating the posterior tibial nerve below the medial malleolus at a site of compression or\\ninjury often causes distal tingling (Tinel's sign). While false-negative results on electrodiagnostic tests are\\nsomewhat common, a positive history combined with supportive physical findings and positive\\nelectrodiagnostic results makes the diagnosis of tarsal tunnel syndrome highly likely. The cause of any\\nswelling near the nerve should be determined.\\nTreatment\\n• Foot inversion, injection, surgery, or a combination\\nStrapping the foot in a neutral or slightly inverted position or wearing an orthotic that keeps the foot\\ninverted reduces nerve tension. Local infiltration of a mixture of an insoluble corticosteroid and an\\nanesthetic may be effective if the cause is inflammation or fibrosis. Surgical decompression may be\\nnecessary to relieve suspected fibro-osseus compression with recalcitrant symptoms.\\n[\\nTable 44-3.\\n Disorders Associated with Heel Pain According to Location]\\nMetatarsalgia\\nMetatarsalgia is a general term for pain in the area of the metatarsophalangeal joints (ball of the\\nfoot). Most common causes include Freiberg's disease, interdigital nerve pain (Morton's\\nneuroma), metatarsophalangeal joint pain, and sesamoiditis.\\nFreiberg's Disease\\nFreiberg's disease is avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head.\\nFreiberg's disease is caused by microtrauma at the metaphysis and growth plate. Avascular necrosis\\nflattens the metatarsal head. The 2nd metatarsal head is most often affected. Freiberg's disease occurs\\nmore frequently among pubertal females and among people who have a short 1st metatarsal bone, which\\nincreases stress on the 2nd metatarsal head and joint.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 44.

Typically, the head of the 2nd metatarsal is widened and\\nflattened, and the metatarsal joint is sclerotic and irregular.\\nSidebar 44-1 Considerations for Using Corticosteroid Injections\\nCorticosteroid injections should be used judiciously to avoid adverse effects. Injectable corticosteroids\\nshould be reserved for inflammation, which is not present in most foot disorders. Because the tarsus,\\nankle, retrocalcaneal space, and dorsum of the toes have little connective tissue between the skin and\\nunderlying bone, injection of insoluble corticosteroids into these structures may cause depigmentation,\\natrophy, or ulceration, especially in elderly patients with peripheral arterial disease.\\nInsoluble corticosteroids can be given deeply rather than superficially with greater safety (eg, in the heel\\npad, tarsal canal, or metatarsal interspaces). The foot should be immobilized for a few days after tendon\\nsheaths are injected. Unusual resistance to injection suggests injection into a tendon. Repeated injection\\ninto a tendon should be avoided because the tendon may weaken (partially tear), predisposing to\\nsubsequent rupture.\\nTreatment\\n• Immobilization and weight unloading if acute, then modification of footwear\\nCorticosteroid injections and immobilization may help to alleviate acutely painful flare-ups. Long-term\\nmanagement may require orthoses with metatarsal bars and low-heeled footwear to reduce stress on the\\n2nd metatarsal head and joint. Corticosteroid injections can be tried, and, rarely, surgical excision of the\\nmetatarsal head may be necessary to relieve recalcitrant pain.\\nInterdigital Nerve Pain\\n(Morton's Neuroma/Neuralgia)\\nInterdigital nerve irritation (neuralgia) or persistent benign enlargement of the perineurium\\n(neuroma) can cause pain, which may be nonspecific, burning, or lancinating, or a foreign body\\nsensation. Diagnosis is usually clinical. Treatment may involve correction of footwear, local\\ninjection, or sometimes surgical excision.\\nThe interdigital nerves of the foot travel beneath and between the metatarsals, extending distally to\\ninnervate the toes. Neuralgia of the interdigital nerve along its distal innervation near the ball of the foot\\ndevelops primarily as a result of improper or constrictive footwear or, less commonly, nerve traction\\nresulting from abnormal foot structure. As a result of chronic repetitive trauma, a benign thickening of the\\nnerve develops (Morton's neuroma).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nInterdigital neuralgia is characterized by pain around the metatarsal heads or the toes. Early interdigital\\nneuralgia often causes an occasional mild ache or discomfort in the ball of the foot, usually when wearing\\na specific shoe, such as those that are too narrow at the front.

In time, patients are unable to wear most shoes. While walking, patients often\\nfalsely sense a pebble in their shoes, which they take off for relief. Neuroma most frequently affects the\\n3rd interspace. Only slightly less common is involvement of the 2nd interspace. Sometimes both\\ninterspaces or feet are involved simultaneously.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nThe symptoms are often specific, and the diagnosis is confirmed by tenderness on plantar palpation of\\nthe interdigital space and reproduction of the radiating burning pain by squeezing the space. Although\\nMRI does not usually confirm neuroma, it may be useful to rule out other interspace lesions or arthritis\\ncausing similar symptoms.\\nTreatment\\n• Modification of footwear and injection\\nNeuralgia of recent onset usually resolves quickly with properly fitting shoes and insoles or with local\\nanesthetic injection. In contrast, neuromas may require one or more perineural infiltrations of long-acting\\ncorticosteroids with a local anesthetic. Injection is at a 45° angle to the foot, into the interspace at the\\nlevel of the dorsal aspect of the metatarsophalangeal joints. An appropriate orthotic often relieves\\nsymptoms. If conservative therapy is ineffective, excision often brings complete relief. However, another\\nneuroma occasionally develops at the site of nerve excision (amputation or stump neuroma).\\nMetatarsophalangeal Joint Pain\\nMetatarsophalangeal joint pain usually results from tissue changes due to aberrant foot\\nbiomechanics. Symptoms and signs include pain with walking and tenderness. Diagnosis is\\nclinical; however, infection or systemic rheumatic diseases (eg, RA) may need to be excluded\\nby testing. Treatment includes orthotics, sometimes local injection, and occasionally surgery.\\nMetatarsophalangeal joint pain most commonly results from misalignment of the joint surfaces with altered\\nfoot biomechanics, causing joint subluxations, capsular impingement, and joint cartilage destruction\\n(osteoarthrosis). Misaligned joints may cause synovial impingement, with minimal if any heat and swelling\\n(osteoarthritic synovitis).\\nMetatarsophalangeal joint subluxations also occur as a result of inflammatory arthropathy, particularly RA.\\nInflammatory synovitis and interosseous muscle atrophy in RA lead to subluxations of the lesser\\nmetatarsophalangeal joints as well, resulting in hammer toe deformities. Consequently, the metatarsal fat\\npad, which usually cushions the stress between the metatarsals and interdigital nerves during walking,\\nmoves distally under the toes; interdigital neuralgia or Morton's neuroma may result. To compensate for\\nthe loss of cushioning, adventitial calluses and bursae may develop.\\nMetatarsophalangeal joint pain may also result from functional hallux limitus, which limits passive and\\nactive joint motion and usually occurs at the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint. Patients usually have foot\\npronation disorders that result in elevation of the 1st ray with lowering of the medial longitudinal arch\\nduring weight bearing. As a result of the 1st ray elevation, the proximal phalanx of the great toe cannot\\nfreely extend on the 1st metatarsal head; the result is jamming at the dorsal joint leading to osteoarthritic\\nchanges and loss of joint motion. Over time, pain may develop, and the joint may become less mobile with\\nan arthrosis (hallux rigidus), which can be debilitating.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms include pain on walking. Dorsal and plantar joint tenderness is usually present on palpation\\nand during passive range of motion. Mild swelling with minimal heat occurs in osteoarthritic synovitis.\\nSignificant warmth, swelling, or redness suggests inflammatory arthropathies or infection.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 44.

Risk factors\\nfor such shortening include a sedentary lifestyle, occupations requiring sitting, very high or low arches in\\nthe feet, and wearing high-heel shoes. The disorder is also common among runners and dancers and\\nmay occur in people whose occupations involve standing or walking on hard surfaces for prolonged\\nperiods.

In medial plantar nerve entrapment, the following are present:\\n• Tenderness is at the medial heel.\\n• Other signs of tarsal tunnel syndrome are absent.\\n• Symptoms can be reproduced by palpation over the proximal aspect of the abductor hal-lucis, the origin\\nof the plantar fascia, or both at the medial tubercle of the calcaneus.\\nTreatment\\n• Orthoses, immobilization, and physical therapy\\nImmobilization and foot orthoses to prevent irritating motion and pressure may be helpful, as may physical\\ntherapy and cryotherapy. If these treatments are ineffective, injection with a sclerosing agent that contains\\nalcohol or careful surgical decompression of the nerve may help relieve pain.\\nPlantar Fibromatosis\\nPlantar fibromatosis is a benign proliferative neoplasia of the plantar fascia.\\nIn plantar fibromatosis, nodules are displayed most easily when the foot is dorsiflexed against the leg.\\nMost patients also have palmar nodules, usually located at the 4th metacarpophalangeal joint. Reported\\nassociations with diabetes, epilepsy, and alcoholism may be anecdotal. Treatment is usually not indicated\\nunless the nodules become large enough to cause pressure-related pain with weight bearing. If so,\\northoses can help redistribute pressure away from the fibrotic nodular lesions. Surgery usually results in\\nrecurrence and may also result in unintentional instability of the foot when fascial removal is excessive.\\nHammer Toe Deformity\\nHammer toe is a C-shaped deformity caused by dorsal subluxation at the metatarsophalangeal\\njoint.\\n[\\nFig. 44-2.\\n Hammer toe.]\\nThe usual cause is misalignment of the joint surfaces due to a genetic predisposition toward aberrant foot\\nbiomechanics and tendon contractures. RA and neurologic disorders such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth\\ndisease are other causes. The 2nd toe is the most common digit to develop a hammer toe deformity (see\\nFig. 44-2\\n). Second toe hammer toes commonly result from an elongated 2nd metatarsal and from\\npressure due to an excessively abducted great toe (hallux valgus deformity) causing a bunion (see\\nbelow). Painful corns (see p. \\n660\\n) often develop in hammer toe deformity, particularly of the 5th toe.\\nReactive adventitial bursas often develop beneath corns, which may become inflamed.\\nSymptoms include pain while wearing shoes, especially shoes with low and narrow toe boxes, and\\nsometimes metatarsalgia.

The cause\\nis often variations in position of the 1st \\nmetatarsal bone or great toe, such as lateral angulation\\nof the great toe (hallux valgus). Secondary osteoarthritis and spur formation are common.\\nSymptoms may include pain and redness, bursitis medial to the joint, and mild synovitis.\\nDiagnosis is usually clinical. Treatment is usually a shoe with a wide toe box, protective pads,\\nand orthotics. For bursitis or synovitis, corticosteroid injection may be helpful.\\nContributing factors may include excessive turning in (pronation) of the ankles, wearing tight and pointed-\\ntoe shoes, and occasionally trauma. Joint misalignment causes osteoarthritis with cartilage erosion and\\nexostosis formation, resulting in joint motion being limited (hallux limitus) or eliminated (hallux rigidus). In\\nlate stages, synovitis occurs, causing joint swelling. In reaction to pressure from tight shoes, an\\nadventitious bursa can develop medial to the joint prominence, which can become painful, swollen, and\\ninflamed (see\\nFig. 44-3\\n).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe initial symptom may be pain at the joint prominence when wearing certain shoes. The joint capsule\\nmay be tender at any stage. Later symptoms may include a painful, warm, red, cystic, movable, fluctuant\\nswelling located medially (adventitial bursitis) and swellings and mild inflammation affecting the entire joint\\n(osteoarthritic synovitis), which is more circumferential. With hallux limitus or rigidus, there is restriction of\\npassive joint motion, tenderness of the lateral aspect of the joint, and increased dorsiflexion of the distal\\nphalanx.\\n[\\nFig. 44-3.\\n Bunion.]\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nClinical findings are usually specific. Acute circumferential intense pain, warmth, swelling, and redness\\nsuggest gouty arthritis or infectious arthritis, mandating examination of synovial fluid. If multiple joints are\\naffected, gout or another systemic rheumatic disease should be considered. If clinical diagnosis of\\nosteoarthritic synovitis is equivocal, x-rays are taken. Suggestive findings include joint space narrowing\\nand bony spurs extending from the metatarsal head or sometimes from the base of the proximal phalanx.\\nPeriarticular erosions (Martel's sign) seen on imaging studies suggest gout.\\nTreatment\\n• Wide toe box, bunion pads, orthotics, or a combination\\n• Treatment of complications\\nMild discomfort may lessen by wearing a shoe with a wide toe box. If not, bunion pads purchased in most\\npharmacies can shield the painful area. Orthotics can also be prescribed to redistribute and relieve\\npressure from the affected articulation. If conservative therapy fails or if the patient is unwilling to wear\\nlarge, wide shoes and orthotics because they are unattractive, surgery aimed at correcting abnormal bony\\nalignments and restoring joint mobility should be strongly considered. For bursitis, bursal aspiration and\\ninjection of a corticosteroid are indicated. For osteoarthritic synovitis, oral NSAIDs or an intra-articular\\ninjection of a corticosteroid/anesthetic solution reduces symptoms. For hallux limitus or hallux rigidus,\\ntreatment aims to preserve joint mobility by using passive stretching exercises, which occasionally require\\ninjection of a local anesthetic to relieve muscle spasm. Sometimes surgical release of contractures is\\nnecessary.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 44. Foot & Ankle Disorders\\n501\"),\n",

Tumors of Bones and Joints\\nIntroduction\\nBone tumors may be primary or metastatic and benign or malignant.\\nIn children, most bone tumors are primary and benign; some are malignant primary tumors (eg,\\nosteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma). Very few are metastatic tumors (eg, neuroblastoma, Wilms' tumor).\\nBone also can be affected by childhood leukemia and lymphomas.\\nIn adults, especially those over age 40, metastatic tumors are about 100 times more common than primary\\nmalignant tumors. Excluding marrow cell tumors (eg, multiple myeloma), there are only about 2500 cases\\nof primary malignant bone tumors in the US each year among children and adults.\\nSynovial tumors are extremely rare in both children and adults. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is a\\nbenign but at times destructive tumor of synovial cells. Synovial sarcoma (often with both spindle cell and\\nglandular-like components) is a malignant soft-tissue tumor not of synovial origin, which seldom occurs\\ninside of a joint.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nBone tumors typically cause unexplained, progressive pain and swelling. Pain can occur without weight\\nbearing or bone stress and can occur at rest and at night.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Plain x-rays\\n• MRI usually and sometimes CT\\n• Bone scan if multicentric or metastatic tumors are suspected\\n• Biopsy unless imaging studies clearly show benign characteristics\\nThe most common reason that diagnosis of bone tumors is delayed is that physicians fail to suspect the\\ntumor and order appropriate imaging studies. Persistent or progressive unexplained pain of the trunk or\\nextremities, particularly if associated with a mass, is suggestive. Plain x-rays are the first test. Tumors\\nshould also be suspected if a radiographic study shows an unexplained abnormality consistent with a\\ntumor. Lesions suggestive of tumors usually require further assessment, often with additional imaging\\nstudies and a biopsy.\\nCharacteristic findings:\\n Some tumors (eg, Paget's disease, nonossifying fibroma, fibrous dysplasia,\\nenchondromas) may have characteristic radiographic findings and can be diagnosed without biopsy.\\nRadiographic findings that suggest cancer include the following:\\n• A lytic, destructive, or permeative appearance\\n• Irregular tumor borders\\n• Areas, especially multiple areas, of bone destruction (moth-eaten appearance)\\n• Cortical destruction\\n• Soft-tissue extension\\n• Pathologic fracture\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 45.

A\\npermeative appearance is characterized by a faint, gradual loss of bone or an infiltrating pattern without\\nclear borders. Certain tumors have a characteristic appearance (eg, Ewing's sarcoma typically shows\\npermeative-type bone destruction, including a large soft-tissue mass with periosteal onion-skin reactive\\nbone often before there is an extensive, lytic, destructive appearance; giant cell tumor has a cystic\\nappearance without a sclerotic interface between the tumor and normal bone). The tumor's location may\\nnarrow diagnostic possibilities (eg, Ewing's sarcoma commonly appears in the shaft of a long bone;\\nosteosarcoma usually appears in the metaphyseal-diaphyseal region toward the end of a long bone; giant\\ncell tumor usually occurs in the epiphysis).\\nSome benign conditions, however, can mimic a malignant tumor:\\n• Heterotopic ossification (myositis ossificans) and exuberant callus formation after fracture can cause\\nmineralization around bony cortices and in adjacent soft tissues, mimicking malignant tumors.\\n• Langerhans' cell histiocytosis (histiocytosis X, Letterer-Siwe disease, Hand-Schuller-Christian disease,\\neosinophilic granuloma) can cause solitary or multiple bone lesions that are usually distinguishable on\\nx-ray. In solitary lesions, there may be periosteal new bone formation, suggesting a malignant bone\\ntumor.\\n• Osteopoikilosis (spotted bones) is an asymptomatic condition of no clinical consequence but can\\nsimulate osteoblastic bone metastases of breast cancer. It is characterized by multiple small, round, or\\noval foci of bony sclerosis, usually in the tarsal, carpal, or pelvic bones or the metaphyseal-epiphyseal\\nregions of tubular bones.\\nOther testing:\\n CT and MRI may help define the location and extent of a bone tumor and sometimes\\nsuggest a specific diagnosis. MRI is usually done if cancer is suspected. If tumors are suspected of being\\nmetastatic or involving multiple foci (multicentric), then radioisotopic technetium bone scanning should be\\ndone to search for all tumors.\\nBiopsy is usually essential for diagnosis of malignant tumors, unless the imaging studies have a\\nclassically benign appearance. The pathologist should be given pertinent details of the clinical history\\nand should review imaging studies. Histopathologic diagnosis may be difficult and requires sufficient\\nviable tissue from a representative portion of the tumor (usually the soft portion). The best results are\\nobtained in centers with extensive experience in bone biopsies. Immediate, accurate, definitive diagnosis\\nis possible in > 90% of cases. If a malignant diagnosis is suspected on frozen section histology, often the\\nsurgeon will wait upon permanent histology before treating definitively. Mistakes occur more frequently in\\nhospitals that infrequently encounter patients with malignant primary tumors.\\nBenign Bone Tumors\\nOsteochondroma:\\n Osteochondromas (osteocartilaginous exostoses), the most common benign bone\\ntumors, may arise from any bone but tend to occur near the ends of long bones. These tumors manifest\\nmost often in people aged 10 to 20 and may be single or multiple. Multiple osteochondromas tend to run\\nin families. Secondary malignant chondrosarcoma develops in about 10% of patients with multiple\\nosteochondromas and in well < 1% of those with single osteochondromas. Osteochondromas rarely\\ncause the bone to fracture.\\nOn imaging studies, the lesion appears as a bony prominence with a cartilage cap (< 2 cm) off the\\nsurface of the bone with no underlying cortex under the prominence.\\nExcision is needed if the tumor is compressing a large nerve; causes pain (especially when impinging on\\nmuscle and creating an inflammatory bursa); disturbs growth; or on imaging study has a destructive\\nappearance, soft-tissue mass, or thickened cartilaginous cap (> 2 cm) suggesting transformation into\\nmalignant chondrosarcoma.\\nEnchondroma:\\n Enchondromas may occur at any age but tend to be recognized in patients aged 10 to\\n40.

They are often found when x-rays are taken\\nfor another reason.\\nOn x-ray, the tumor may appear as a lobulated calcified area within bone; some lesions are less calcified,\\nwith areas of stippled calcification either on plain films or CT. If adjacent to the cortex, enchondromas\\nshow minor endosteal scalloping. Almost all enchondromas have increased uptake on a bone scan and\\nthus create concern of cancer. X-ray findings, including MRI and CT, may be diagnostic; if they are not,\\nand especially if the tumor (not the associated joint) is painful, the diagnosis should be confirmed by\\nbiopsy. To help differentiate bone pain from joint pain, the joint can be injected, usually with a long-lasting\\nanesthetic (eg, bupivacaine); if pain persists, it may be caused by the bone lesion.\\nAn asymptomatic enchondroma does not need biopsy, excision, or other treatment (usually curettage);\\nhowever, follow-up imaging studies are indicated to rule out disease progression. These are done at 6 mo\\nand again at 1 yr or whenever symptoms develop.\\nChondroblastoma:\\n Chondroblastoma is rare and occurs most commonly among people aged 10 to 20.\\nArising in the epiphysis, this tumor may continue to grow and destroy bone and the joint. It appears on\\nimaging studies as a sclerotic marginated cyst containing spots of punctate calcification. MRI can help\\ndiagnostically by showing characteristic changes well away from the lesion.\\nThe tumor must be surgically removed by curettage, and the cavity must be bone grafted. Local\\nrecurrence rate is about 10 to 20%, and recurrent lesions often resolve with repeat bone curettage and\\nbone grafting.\\nChondromyxofibroma:\\n Chondromyxofibroma is very rare and usually occurs before age 30. The\\nappearance on imaging studies (usually eccentric, sharply circumscribed, lytic, and located near the end\\nof long bones) suggests the diagnosis. Treatment after biopsy is surgical excision or curettage.\\nOsteoid osteoma:\\n Osteoid osteoma, which tends to affect young people (commonly aged 10 to 35), can\\noccur in any bone but is most common among long bones. It can cause pain (usually worse at night) that\\nis typically relieved by mild analgesics, particularly aspirin or other NSAIDs. In growing children, the\\ninflammatory response and associated hyperemia, if close to the open growth plate, may cause\\novergrowth and limb length discrepancy. Physical examination may reveal atrophy of regional muscles\\nbecause the pain causes muscle disuse.\\nCharacteristic appearance on imaging studies is a small radiolucent zone surrounded by a larger sclerotic\\nzone. If a tumor is suspected, a technetium-99m bone scan should be done; an osteoid osteoma appears\\nas an area of increased uptake. CT with fine image sequences is also done and is most helpful in\\ndistinguishing the lesion.\\nRemoval of the small radiolucent zone with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation provides permanent\\nrelief. Most osteoid osteomas are treated by an interventional musculoskeletal radiologist using\\npercutaneous techniques and anesthesia. Less often, osteoid osteomas are surgically curetted or\\nexcised.\\nBenign giant cell tumor:\\n These tumors, which most commonly affect people in their 20s and 30s, occur\\nin the epiphyses and may eventually erode the rest of the bone and extend into the soft tissues. They\\nmay cause pain. Giant cell tumors are notorious for their tendency to recur. Rarely, a giant cell tumor may\\nmetastasize to the lung, even though it remains histologically benign.\\nBenign giant cell tumors appear as expansile lytic lesions on imaging. On imaging studies, there is a\\nmargin without a sclerotic rim where the tumor ends and normal trabecular bone begins.\\nMost benign giant cell tumors are treated by curettage and packing with methyl methacrylate or by bone\\ngraft. To reduce recurrence rate, surgeons often prefer using an adjuvant such as thermal heat (provided\\nby the hardening of methyl methacrylate) or chemically by phenol or freezing with liquid nitrogen. If a\\ntumor is very large and destructive to the joint, complete excision with joint reconstruction may be\\nnecessary.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 45.

It is of hematopoietic derivation\\n(see also p. \\n1029\\n) and occurs mostly in older adults. The neoplastic process is usually multicentric and\\noften involves the bone marrow so diffusely that bone marrow aspiration is diagnostic. Imaging studies\\nusually show sharply circumscribed lytic lesions or diffuse demineralization. Rarely, the lesion can appear\\nas sclerotic or as diffuse osteopenia, especially in a vertebral body. An isolated single myeloma lesion\\nwithout systemic marrow involvement is called a plasmacytoma.\\nOsteosarcoma:\\n Osteosarcoma (osteogenic sarcoma) is the 2nd most common primary bone tumor and\\nis highly malignant. It is most common among people aged 10 to 25, although it can occur at any age.\\nOsteosarcoma produces malignant osteoid (immature bone) from tumor bone cells. Osteosarcoma usually\\ndevelops around the knee (distal femur more often than proximal tibia) or in other long bones, particularly\\nthe metaphyseal-diaphyseal area, and may metastasize, usually to lung or other bone. Pain and swelling\\nare the usual symptoms.\\nFindings on imaging studies vary and may include sclerotic or lytic features. Diagnosis requires biopsy.\\nPatients need a chest x-ray and CT to detect lung metastases and a bone scan to detect bone\\nmetastases.\\nTreatment is a combination of chemotherapy and surgery. Use of adjuvant chemotherapy increases\\nsurvival from < 20% to > 65% at 5 yr. Chemotherapy usually begins before any surgery. Decreased tumor\\nsize on x-ray, decreased pain level, and decreased serum alkaline phosphatase indicate some response,\\nbut the desired response is for > 95% tumor necrosis on mapping of the resected specimen. After several\\ncourses of chemotherapy (over several months), limb-sparing surgery and limb reconstruction can\\nproceed. In limb-sparing surgery, the tumor is resected en bloc, including all surrounding reactive tissue\\nand a rim of surrounding normal tissue; to avoid microscopic spillage of tumor cells, the tumor is not\\nviolated. More than 80% of patients can be treated with limb-sparing surgery without decreasing long-\\nterm survival rate. Continuation of chemotherapy after surgery is usually necessary. If there is nearly\\ncomplete tumor necrosis (about 99%) from preoperative chemotherapy, 5-yr survival rate is > 90%.\\nFibrosarcoma:\\n Fibrosarcomas have similar characteristics to osteosarcomas but produce fibrous tumor\\ncells (rather than bone tumor cells), affect the same age group, and pose similar problems.\\nMalignant fibrous histiocytoma:\\n This tumor is clinically similar to osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma,\\nalthough malignant fibrous histiocytomas have been classified as different from the osteosarcoma group\\nbecause of a different histology (no tumor bone production). Malignant fibrous histiocytomas tend to\\noccur in children and teenagers but can also occur in older adults as secondary lesions in bone infarcts\\nand radiation fields. Treatment is similar to that of osteosarcoma.\\nChondrosarcoma:\\n Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors of cartilage. They differ from osteosarcomas\\nclinically, therapeutically, and prognostically. Of chondrosarcomas, 90% are primary tumors.\\nChondrosarcomas arise in other pre-existing conditions, particularly multiple osteochondromas and\\nmultiple enchondromatosis (eg, in Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome). Chondrosarcomas tend to\\noccur in older adults. They often develop in flat bones (eg, pelvis, scapula) but can develop in any portion\\nof any bone and can implant in surrounding soft tissues.\\nX-rays often reveal punctate calcifications. Primary chondrosarcomas often also exhibit cortical bone\\ndestruction and loss of normal bone trabeculae. Secondary chondrosarcoma may be suggested by the\\nappearance of punctate calcifications or an increase in size of an osteochondroma. Technetium-99m\\nbone scintigraphy is a helpful screening study; all cartilaginous lesions show increased uptake on the\\nscan, although chondrosarcomas exhibit particularly high uptake. Biopsy is required for diagnosis and can\\nalso determine the tumor's grade (probability of metastasizing).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 45.

Other tumors are treated with total surgical resection. When surgical resection\\nwith maintenance of function is impossible, amputation may be necessary. Because of the potential to\\nimplant the tumor, meticulous care must be taken to avoid spillage of tumor cells into the soft tissues\\nduring biopsy or surgery. Recurrence is inevitable if tumor cells spill. If no spillage occurs, the cure rate\\ndepends on the tumor grade. Low-grade tumors are nearly all cured with adequate treatment. Because\\nthese tumors have limited vascularity, chemotherapy and radiation therapy have little efficacy.\\nEwing's sarcoma of bone:\\n Ewing's sarcoma is a round-cell bone tumor with a peak incidence between\\n10 and 25 yr. Most develop in the extremities, but any bone may be involved. Ewing's sarcoma tends to\\nbe extensive, sometimes involving the entire bone shaft, most often the diaphyseal region. About 15 to\\n20% occur around the metaphyseal region. Pain and swelling are the most common symptoms.\\nLytic destruction, particularly a permeative infiltrating pattern without clear borders, is the most common\\nfinding on imaging, but multiple layers of subperiosteal reactive new bone formation may give an onion-\\nskin appearance. X-rays do not usually reveal the full extent of bone involvement, and a large soft-tissue\\nmass usually surrounds the affected bone. MRI better defines disease extent, which can help guide\\ntreatment. Many other benign and malignant tumors can appear very similar, so diagnosis is made by\\nbiopsy. At times this tumor may be confused with an infection. Accurate histologic diagnosis can be\\naccomplished with molecular markers, including evaluation for a typical clonal chromosomal abnormality.\\nTreatment includes various combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Currently, >\\n60% of patients with primary localized Ewing's sarcoma may be cured by this multimodal approach. Cure\\nis sometimes possible even with metastatic disease. Chemotherapy in conjunction with surgical en bloc\\nresection, if applicable, often yields better long-term results.\\nLymphoma of bone:\\n Lymphoma of bone (previously known as reticulum cell sarcoma) affects adults,\\nusually in their 40s and 50s. It may arise in any bone. The tumor consists of small round cells, often with\\na mixture of reticulum cells, lymphoblasts, and lymphocytes. It can develop as an isolated primary bone\\ntumor, in association with similar tumors in other tissues, or as a metastasis from known soft-tissue\\nlymphomatous disease. Pain and swelling are the usual symptoms. Pathologic fracture is common.\\nImaging studies reveal bone destruction, which may be in a mottled or patchy or even infiltrating,\\npermeative pattern, often with a clinical and radiographic large soft-tissue mass. In advanced disease, the\\nentire outline of the affected bone may be lost.\\nIn isolated primary bone lymphoma, the 5-yr survival rate is ≥ 50%. Combination radiation therapy and\\nchemotherapy is as curative as amputation or other extensive ablative surgery. Stabilization of long bones\\nis often necessary to prevent pathologic fracture. Amputation is indicated only rarely, when function is lost\\nbecause of pathologic fracture or extensive soft-tissue involvement that cannot be managed otherwise.\\nMalignant giant cell tumor:\\n Malignant giant cell tumor, which is rare, is usually located at the extreme\\nend of a long bone. X-ray reveals classic features of malignant destruction (predominantly lytic\\ndestruction, cortical destruction, soft-tissue extension, and pathologic fracture). A malignant giant cell\\ntumor that develops in a previously benign giant cell tumor is characteristically radioresistant. Treatment\\nis similar to that of osteosarcoma, but the cure rate is low.\\nChordoma:\\n Chordoma, which is rare, develops from the remnants of the primitive notochord. \\nIt tends to\\noccur at the ends of the spinal column, usually in the middle of the sacrum or near the base of the skull. A\\nchordoma in the sacrococcygeal region causes nearly constant pain. A chordoma in the base of the skull\\ncan cause deficits in a cranial nerve, most commonly in nerves to the eye.\\nSymptoms may exist for months to several years before diagnosis. A chordoma appears on imaging\\nstudies as an expansile, destructive bone lesion that may be associated with a soft-tissue mass.\\nMetastasis is unusual, but local recurrence is not. Chordomas in the sacrococcygeal region may be cured\\nby radical en bloc excision. Chordomas in the base of the skull are usually inaccessible to surgery but\\nmay respond to radiation therapy.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 45.

Bone\\nmetastases may cause symptoms before the primary tumor is suspected or may appear in patients with a\\nknown diagnosis of cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\n• X-ray\\n• Radionuclide scanning to identify all metastases\\n• Clinical evaluation and testing to diagnose the primary tumor (if unknown)\\n• Often biopsy if the primary tumor is unknown after assessment\\nMetastatic bone tumors are considered in all patients with unexplained bone pain, but particularly in\\npatients who have\\n• Known cancer\\n• Pain at more than one site\\n• Findings on imaging studies that suggest metastases\\nProstate cancer is most often blastic, lung cancer is most often lytic, and breast cancer may be blastic or\\nlytic.\\nCT and MRI are highly sensitive for specific metastases. However, if metastases are suspected, a\\nradionuclide whole-body scan, which is not quite as sensitive, is usually done. Bone scan is more\\nsensitive for early and asymptomatic metastases than plain x-rays and can be used to scan the entire\\nbody. Lesions on the scan are usually presumed to be metastases if the patient has a known primary\\ncancer. Metastases should be suspected in patients who have multiple lesions on bone scan.

Initial CT of\\nthe chest, abdomen, and pelvis may also reveal the primary tumor. However, bone biopsy, especially fine-\\nneedle or core biopsy, is necessary if metastatic tumor is suspected and the primary tumor has not been\\notherwise diagnosed. Biopsy with use of immunohistologic stains may give clues to the primary tumor\\ntype.\\nTreatment\\n• Usually radiation therapy\\n• Surgery to stabilize bone at risk of pathologic fracture\\n• Kyphoplasty or vertebraplasty for certain painful vertebral fractures\\nTreatment depends on the type of tissue involved (which organ tissue type). Radiation therapy, combined\\nwith selected chemotherapeutic or hormonal drugs, is the most common treatment modality. Early use of\\nradiation (30 Gy) and bisphosphonates (eg, zoledronate, pamidronate) slows bone destruction. Some\\ntumors are more likely to heal after radiation \\ntherapy; for example, blastic lesions of prostate and breast\\ncancer are more likely to heal than lytic destructive lesions of lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma.\\nIf bone destruction is extensive, resulting in imminent or actual pathologic fracture, surgical fixation or\\nresection and reconstruction may be required to provide stabilization and help minimize morbidity. When\\nthe primary cancer has been removed and only a single bone metastasis remains (especially if the\\nmetastatic lesion appears ≥ 1 yr after the primary tumor), en bloc excision sometimes combined with\\nradiation therapy, chemotherapy, or both rarely may be curative. Insertion of methyl methacrylate into the\\nspine (kyphoplasty or vertebraplasty) relieves pain and expands and stabilizes compression fractures that\\ndo not have epidural soft-tissue extension.\\nOther Bone Lesions\\nMany nonneoplastic conditions of bone may clinically or radiologically mimic solitary bone tumors.\\nUnicameral bone cyst:\\n Simple unicameral bone cysts occur in the long bones starting distal to the\\nepiphyseal plate in children. The cyst causes the cortex to thin and predisposes the area to a buckle-like\\npathologic fracture, which is usually how the cyst is recognized. Cysts < 5 cm may heal and may\\ndisappear as the fracture heals. Cysts > 5 cm, particularly in children, may require excision or curettage\\nand bone grafting; however, many respond to injections of corticosteroids, demineralized bone matrix, or\\nsynthetic bone substitutes. The response may be variable and may require multiple injections.\\nRegardless of treatment, cysts persist in about 10 to 15% of patients.\\nFibrous dysplasia:\\n Fibrous dysplasia involves abnormal bone development during childhood. It may\\naffect one or several bones. Cutaneous pigmentation and endocrine abnormalities may be present\\n(Albright's syndrome). The abnormal bone lesions of fibrous dysplasia commonly stop developing at\\npuberty. They rarely undergo malignant degeneration. On x-ray, the lesions can appear cystic and may be\\nextensive and deforming. Calcitonin may help relieve pain. Progressive deformities, fractures that do not\\nheal with immobilization, or intractable pain may be effectively treated with orthopedic surgery.\\nAneurysmal bone cyst:\\n An aneurysmal bone cyst is an idiopathic expansile lesion that usually develops\\nbefore age 25 yr. This cystic lesion usually occurs in the metaphyseal region of the long bones, but\\nalmost any bone may be affected. It tends to grow slowly. A periosteal new bone shell forms around the\\nexpansile lesion and is often wider than the original bone. Pain and swelling are common.

Approach to the Patient With Ear Problems\\nIntroduction\\nEarache, hearing loss, otorrhea, tinnitus, and vertigo are the principal symptoms of ear problems. Hearing\\nloss is discussed in \\nCh. 47\\n.\\nIn addition to the ears, nose, nasopharynx, and paranasal sinuses, the teeth, tongue, tonsils,\\nhypopharynx, larynx, salivary glands, and temporomandibular joint are examined; pain and discomfort\\nmay be referred from them to the ears. It is important to examine cranial nerve function (see pp. \\n1587\\n and\\n1745\\n) and to perform tests of hearing (see p. \\n431\\n) and of the vestibular apparatus. The patient is also\\nexamined for nystagmus (a rhythmic movement of the eyes—see \\nSidebar 46-1\\n).\\nTesting\\nPatients with abnormal hearing on history or physical examination or with tinnitus or vertigo undergo an\\naudiogram (see p. \\n433\\n). Patients with nystagmus or altered vestibular function may benefit from\\ncomputerized electronystagmography (ENG), which quantifies spontaneous, gaze, or positional\\nnystagmus that might not be visually detectable. Computerized ENG caloric testing quantifies the strength\\nof response of the vestibular system to cool and warm irrigations in each ear, enabling the physician to\\ndiscriminate unilateral weakness. Different components of the vestibular system can be tested by varying\\nhead and body position or by presenting visual stimuli.\\nSidebar 46-1 Nystagmus\\nNystagmus is a rhythmic movement of the eyes that can have various causes. Vestibular disorders can\\nresult in nystagmus because the vestibular system and the oculomotor nuclei are interconnected. The\\npresence of vestibular nystagmus helps identify vestibular disorders and sometimes distinguishes central\\nfrom peripheral vertigo. Vestibular nystagmus has a slow component caused by the vestibular input and a\\nquick, corrective component that causes movement in the opposite direction. The direction of the\\nnystagmus is defined by the direction of the quick component because it is easier to see. Nystagmus may\\nbe rotary, vertical, or horizontal and may occur spontaneously, with gaze, or with head motion.\\nInitial inspection for nystagmus is done with the patient lying supine with unfocused gaze (+30 diopter or\\nFrenzel lenses can be used to prevent gaze fixation). The patient is then slowly rotated to a left and then\\nto a right lateral position. The direction and duration of nystagmus are noted. If nystagmus is not\\ndetected, the Dix-Hallpike (or Barany) maneuver is done. In this maneuver, the patient sits erect on a\\nstretcher so that when lying back, the head extends beyond the end. With support, the patient is rapidly\\nlowered to horizontal, and the head is extended back 45° below horizontal and rotated 45° to the left.\\nDirection and duration of nystagmus and development of vertigo are noted. The patient is returned to an\\nupright position, and the maneuver is repeated with rotation to the right. Any position or maneuver that\\ncauses nystagmus should be repeated to see whether it fatigues.\\nNystagmus secondary to peripheral nervous system disorders has a latency period of 3 to 10 sec and\\nfatigues rapidly, whereas nystagmus secondary to CNS has no latency period and does not fatigue.\\nDuring induced nystagmus, the patient is instructed to focus on an object. Nystagmus caused by\\nperipheral disorders is inhibited by visual fixation. Because Frenzel lenses prevent visual fixation, they\\nmust be removed to assess visual fixation.\\nCaloric stimulation of the ear canal induces nystagmus in a person with an intact vestibular system.\\nFailure to induce nystagmus or > 20% difference in duration between sides suggests a lesion on the side\\nof the decreased response. Quantification of caloric response is best done with formal (computerized)\\nelectronystagmography.\\nAbility of the vestibular system to respond to peripheral stimulation can be assessed at the bedside.

Most tinnitus is subjective.\\nObjective tinnitus\\n is uncommon and results from noise generated by structures near the ear. Sometimes\\nthe tinnitus is loud enough to be heard by the examiner.\\nCharacteristics:\\n Tinnitus may be described as buzzing, ringing, roaring, whistling, or hissing and is\\nsometimes variable and complex. Objective tinnitus typically is pulsatile (synchronous with the heartbeat)\\nor intermittent. Tinnitus is most noticeable in quiet environments and in the absence of distracting stimuli\\nand, thus, frequently seems worse at bedtime.\\nTinnitus may be intermittent or continuous. Continuous tinnitus is at best annoying and is often quite\\ndistressing. Some patients adapt to its presence better than others; depression occasionally results.\\nStress generally exacerbates tinnitus.\\nPathophysiology\\nSubjective tinnitus\\n is thought to be caused by abnormal neuronal activity in the auditory cortex. This\\nactivity results when input from the auditory pathway (cochlea, auditory nerve, brain stem nuclei, auditory\\ncortex) is disrupted or altered in some manner. This disruption may cause loss of suppression of intrinsic\\ncortical activity and perhaps creation of new neural connections. Some believe the phenomenon is similar\\nto the development of phantom limb pain after amputation. Conductive hearing loss (eg, caused by\\ncerumen impaction, otitis media, or eustachian tube dysfunction) may also be associated with subjective\\ntinnitus, by altering sound input to the central auditory system.\\nObjective tinnitus\\n represents actual noise generated by physiologic phenomena occurring near the\\nmiddle ear. Usually the noise comes from blood vessels, either normal vessels in conditions of increased\\nor turbulent flow (eg, caused by atherosclerosis) or abnormal vessels (eg, in tumors or vascular\\nmalformations).

Hearing Loss\\nIntroduction\\nNearly 10% of people in the US have some degree of hearing loss. About 1/800 to 1/1000 neonates are\\nborn with severe to profound hearing loss. Two to 3 times as many are born with lesser hearing loss.\\nDuring childhood, another 2 to 3/1000 children acquire moderate to severe hearing loss. Adolescents are\\nat risk from excessive exposure to noise, head trauma, or both. Older adults typically experience a\\nprogressive decrease in hearing (presbycusis—see p. \\n438\\n), which is probably related to aging and noise\\nexposure.\\nHearing deficits in early childhood can result in lifelong impairments in receptive and expressive language\\nskills. The severity of the handicap is determined by the age at which the hearing loss occurred; the\\nnature of the loss (its duration, the frequencies affected, and the degree); and the susceptibilities of the\\nindividual child (eg, coexisting visual impairment, intellectual disability, primary language deficits,\\ninadequate linguistic environment). Children who have other sensory, linguistic, or cognitive deficiencies\\nare affected most severely.\\nPathophysiology\\nHearing loss can be classified as conductive, sensorineural, or both (mixed loss).\\nConductive hearing loss\\n occurs secondary to lesions in the external auditory canal, tympanic\\nmembrane (TM), or middle ear. These lesions prevent sound from being effectively conducted to the inner\\near.\\nSensorineural hearing loss\\n is caused by lesions of either the inner ear (sensory) or the auditory (8th)\\nnerve (neural—see\\nTable 47-1\\n). This distinction is important because sensory\\n[\\nTable 47-1.\\n Differences Between Sensory and Neural Hearing Losses]\\nhearing loss is sometimes reversible and is seldom life threatening. A neural hearing loss is rarely\\nrecoverable and may be due to a potentially life-threatening brain tumor—commonly a cerebellopontine\\nangle tumor.\\nMixed loss\\n may be caused by severe head injury with or without fracture of the skull or temporal bone,\\nby chronic infection, or by one of many genetic disorders. It may also occur when a transient conductive\\nhearing loss, commonly due to otitis media, is superimposed on a sensorineural hearing loss.\\nEtiology\\nHearing loss can be congenital (see\\nTable 47-2\\n) or acquired (see\\nTable 47-3\\n), progressive or sudden (see also p. \\n438\\n), temporary or permanent, unilateral or bilateral, and\\nmild or profound.

Foreign bodies obstructing the canal are sometimes a problem in children, both because of their\\npresence and because of any damage inadvertently caused during their removal.\\nNoise\\n can cause sudden or gradual sensorineural hearing loss. In acoustic trauma, hearing loss results\\nfrom exposure to a single, extreme noise (eg, a nearby gunshot or explosion); some patients have tinnitus\\nas well. The loss is usually temporary (unless there is also blast damage, which may destroy the TM,\\nossicles, or both). In noise-induced hearing loss, the loss develops over time because of chronic\\nexposure to noise > 85 decibels (dB—see \\nSidebar 47-1\\n on p. \\n434\\n).

SOM can also be caused by eustachian \\ntube dysfunction (eg,\\nresulting from cleft palate, benign or malignant tumors of the nasopharynx, or rapid changes in external\\nair pressure as occur during descent from high altitudes or rapid ascent while scuba diving).\\nAutoimmune disorders\\n can cause sensorineural hearing loss at all ages and can cause other\\nsymptoms and signs as well.\\nEvaluation\\nEvaluation consists of detecting and quantifying hearing loss and determining etiology (particularly\\nreversible causes).\\nScreening:\\n Most adults and older children notice a sudden hearing loss, and caregivers may suspect\\nthat a neonate has a severe hearing loss within the first week of life when the neonate does not respond\\nto voices or other sounds. However, progressive losses and nearly all losses in infants and young\\nchildren must be detected by screening. Screening should begin at birth (see p. \\n2717\\n) so that linguistic\\ninput can allow optimal language development. Suspected hearing loss at any time should prompt referral\\nto a specialist. If screening is not done, severe bilateral losses may not be recognized until age 2 yr, and\\nmild to moderate or severe unilateral losses are often not recognized until children reach school age.\\nHistory: History of present illness\\n should note how long hearing loss has been perceived, how it\\nbegan (eg, gradual, acute), whether it is unilateral or bilateral, and whether sound is distorted (eg, music\\nis off—dull or lifeless) or there is difficulty with speech discrimination. The patient should be asked\\nwhether the loss followed any acute event (eg, head injury, barotrauma [particularly a diving injury],\\nstarting of a drug). Important accompanying symptoms include other otologic symptoms (eg, ear pain,\\ntinnitus, ear discharge), vestibular symptoms (eg, disorientation in the dark, vertigo), and other neurologic\\nsymptoms (eg, headache, weakness or asymmetry of the face, an abnormal sense of taste, fullness of\\nthe ear). In children, important associated symptoms include presence of delays in speech or language\\ndevelopment and delayed motor development.\\nReview of systems\\n should seek to determine the impact of hearing difficulty on the patient's life.\\nPast medical history\\n should note previous possibly causative disorders, including CNS infection,\\nrepeated ear infections, chronic exposure to loud noise, head trauma, rheumatic disorders (eg, RA,\\nlupus), and a family history of hearing loss. Drug history should specifically query current or previous use\\nof ototoxic drugs (see \\nTable 47-3\\n).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 47.

The external ear is inspected for obstruction, infection, congenital malformations, and other\\nlesions. The TM is examined for perforation, drainage, otitis media, and cholesteatoma. During the\\nneurologic examination, particular attention needs to be paid to the 2nd through 7th cranial nerves as well\\nas to vestibular and cerebellar function because abnormalities in these areas often occur with tumors of\\nthe brain stem and cerebellopontine angle. Weber's test and the Rinne test require a tuning fork to\\ndifferentiate conductive from sensorineural hearing loss.\\nIn \\nWeber's test\\n, the stem of a vibrating 512-Hz or 1024-Hz tuning fork is placed on the midline of the\\nhead, and the patient indicates in which ear the tone is louder. In unilateral conductive hearing loss, the\\ntone is louder in the ear with hearing loss. In unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, the tone is louder in\\nthe normal ear because the tuning fork stimulates both inner ears equally and the patient perceives the\\nstimulus with the unaffected ear.\\nIn the \\nRinne test\\n, hearing by bone and by air conduction is compared. Bone conduction bypasses the\\nexternal and middle ear and tests the integrity of the inner ear, 8th cranial nerve, and central auditory\\npathways. The stem of a vibrating tuning fork is held against the mastoid (for bone conduction); as soon\\nas the sound is no longer perceived, the fork is removed from the mastoid, and the still-vibrating tines are\\nheld close to the pinna (for air conduction). Normally, the fork can once more be heard, indicating that air\\nconduction is better than bone conduction. With conductive hearing loss, the relationship is reversed;\\nbone conduction is louder than air conduction. With sensorineural hearing loss, both air and bone\\nconduction are reduced, but air conduction remains louder.\\nRed flags:\\n Findings of particular concern are\\n• Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss\\n• Abnormalities of cranial nerves (other than hearing loss)\\nInterpretation of findings:\\n Many causes of hearing loss (eg, cerumen, injury, significant noise exposure,\\ninfectious sequelae, drugs) are readily apparent based on results of the examination (see \\nTable 47-3\\n).\\nAssociated findings are helpful in diagnosing the remaining small number of patients in\\n[\\nTable 47-3.\\n Some Causes of Acquired Hearing Loss]\\nwhom no clear cause can be found.

An audiometer delivers sounds of specific frequencies\\n(pure tones) at different intensities to determine the patient's hearing threshold (how loud a sound must\\nbe to be perceived) for each frequency. Hearing in each ear is tested from 125 or 250 to 8000 Hz by air\\nconduction (using earphones) and up to 4 kHz by bone conduction (using an oscillator in contact with the\\nmastoid process or forehead). Test results are plotted on graphs called audiograms (see\\nFig. 47-1\\n), which show the difference between the patient's hearing threshold and normal hearing at each\\nfrequency. The difference is measured in dB (see \\nSidebar 47-1\\n). The normal threshold is considered 0 dB\\nhearing level (Hl); hearing loss is considered present if the patient's threshold is > 25 dB Hl. When\\nhearing loss is such as to require loud test tones, intense tones presented to one ear may be heard in the\\nother ear. In such cases, a masking sound, usually narrow band noise, is presented to the ear not being\\ntested to isolate it.\\nSpeech audiometry includes the speech reception threshold (SRT) and the word recognition score. The\\nSRT is a measure of the intensity at which speech is recognized. To \\ndetermine the SRT, the examiner\\npresents the patient with a list of words at specific sound intensities. These words usually have 2 equally\\naccented syllables (spondees), such as railroad, staircase, and baseball. The examiner notes the\\nintensity at which the patient repeats 50% of the words correctly. The SRT approximates the average\\nhearing level at speech frequencies (eg, 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz).\\nSidebar 47-1 Sound Levels\\nSound intensity and pressure (the physical correlates of loudness) are measured in decibels (dB). A dB is\\na unitless figure that compares 2 values and is defined as the logarithm of the ratio of a measured value\\nto a reference value, multiplied by a constant:\\ndB = k log (V\\nmeasured\\n/V\\nref\\n)\\nBy convention, the reference value for sound pressure level (SPL) is taken as the quietest 1000-Hz\\nsound detectable by young, healthy human ears.\\n*\\n The sound may be measured in terms of pressure\\n(N/m\\n2\\n) or intensity (watts/m\\n2\\n).\\nBecause sound intensity equals the square of sound pressure, the constant (k) for SPL is 20; for sound\\nintensity, 10. Thus, each 20-dB increase represents a 10-fold increase in SPL but a 100-fold increase in\\nsound intensity.\\nThe dB values in the table below give only a rough idea of the risk of hearing loss.

It is commonly used to screen children for middle ear effusions. A probe containing a\\nsound source, microphone, and air pressure regulator is placed snugly with an airtight seal into the ear\\ncanal. The probe microphone records the reflected sound from the TM while pressure in the canal is\\nvaried. Normally, maximal compliance of the middle ear occurs when the pressure in the ear canal equals\\natmospheric pressure. Abnormal compliance patterns suggest specific anatomic disruptions. In eustachian\\ntube obstruction and middle ear effusion, maximal compliance occurs with a negative pressure in the ear\\ncanal. When the ossicular chain is disrupted, as in necrosis or dislocation of the long process of the\\nincus, the middle ear is excessively compliant. When the ossicular chain is fixed, as in stapedial ankylosis\\nin otosclerosis, compliance may be normal or reduced.\\nThe acoustic reflex is contraction of the stapedius muscle in response to loud sounds, \\nwhich changes the\\ncompliance of the TM, protecting the middle ear from acoustic trauma.

In addition, various coping mechanisms\\nmay help.\\nHearing aids:\\n Amplification of sound with a hearing aid helps many people. Although hearing aids do not\\nrestore hearing to normal, they can significantly improve communication. Physicians should encourage\\nhearing aid use and help patients overcome a sense of social stigma that continues to obstruct use of\\nthese devices, perhaps by making the analogy that a hearing aid is to hearing as eye glasses are to\\nseeing.\\nAll hearing aids have a microphone, amplifier, speaker, earpiece, and volume control, although they differ\\nin the location of these components. An audiologist should be involved in selection and fitting of a hearing\\naid.\\nThe best models are adjusted to a person's particular pattern of hearing loss. People with mainly high-\\nfrequency hearing loss do not benefit from simple amplification, which merely makes the garbled speech\\nthey hear sound louder. They usually need a hearing aid that selectively amplifies the high frequencies.\\nSome hearing aids contain vents in the ear mold, which facilitate the passage of high-frequency sound\\nwaves. Some use digital sound processing with multiple frequency channels so that amplification more\\nprecisely matches hearing loss as measured on the audiogram.\\nTelephone use can be difficult for people with hearing aids. Typical hearing aids cause squealing when\\nthe ear is placed next to the phone handle. Some hearing aids have a phone coil with a switch that turns\\nthe microphone off and links the phone coil electromagnetically to the speaker magnet in the phone.\\nFor moderate to severe hearing loss, a postauricular (ear-level) aid, which fits behind the pinna and is\\ncoupled to the ear mold with \\nflexible tubing, is appropriate. An in-the-ear aid is contained entirely within\\nthe ear mold and fits less conspicuously into the concha and ear canal; it is appropriate for mild to\\nmoderate hearing loss. Some people with mild hearing loss limited to high frequencies are most\\ncomfortably fitted with postauricular aids and completely open ear canals.

The\\nCROS aid (contralateral routing of signals) is occasionally used for severe unilateral hearing loss; a\\nhearing-aid microphone is placed in the nonfunctioning ear, and sound is routed to the functioning ear\\nthrough a wire or radio transmitter. This device enables the wearer to hear sounds from the\\nnonfunctioning side, allowing for some limited capacity to localize sound. If the better ear also has some\\nhearing loss, the sound from both sides can be amplified with the binaural CROS (BiCROS) aid. The\\nbody aid type is appropriate for profound hearing loss. It is worn in a shirt pocket or a body harness and\\nconnected by a wire to the earpiece (the receiver), which is coupled to the ear canal by a plastic insert\\n(ear mold).\\nA bone conduction aid may be used when an ear mold or tube cannot be used, as in atresia of the ear\\ncanal or persistent otorrhea. An oscillator is held against the head, usually over the mastoid, with a spring\\nband, and sound is conducted through the skull to the cochlea. Bone conduction hearing aids require\\nmore power, introduce more distortion, and are less comfortable to wear than air conduction hearing aids.\\nSome bone conduction aids (bone-anchored hearing aids or BAHAs) are surgically implanted in the\\nmastoid process, avoiding the discomfort and prominence of the spring band.\\nCochlear implants:\\n Profoundly deaf patients, including those with some hearing but who even with a\\nhearing aid cannot understand speech without the assistance of vision (lip-reading or speech-reading),\\nmay benefit from a cochlear implant. This device provides electrical signals directly into the auditory nerve\\nvia multiple electrodes implanted in the cochlea. An external microphone and processor convert sound\\nwaves to electrical impulses, which are transmitted through the skin electromagnetically from an external\\ninduction coil to an internal coil implanted in the skull above and behind the ear. The internal coil\\nconnects to electrodes inserted in the scala tympani.\\nCochlear implants help with speech-reading by providing information about the intonation of words and\\nthe rhythm of speech. Many if not most adults with cochlear implants can discriminate words without\\nvisual clues, allowing them to talk on the telephone. Cochlear implants enable deaf people to hear and\\ndistinguish environmental sounds and warning signals. They also help deaf people modulate their voice\\nand make their speech more intelligible.\\nBrain stem implants:\\n Patients who have had both acoustic nerves destroyed (eg, by bilateral temporal\\nbone fractures or neurofibromatosis) can have some hearing restored by means of brain stem implants\\nthat have electrodes connected to sound-detecting and sound-processing devices similar to those used\\nfor cochlear implants.\\nCoping mechanisms:\\n Alerting systems that use light let people know when the doorbell is ringing, a\\nsmoke detector is sounding, or a baby is crying. Special sound systems transmitting infrared or FM radio\\nsignals help people hear in theaters, churches, or other places where competing noise exists. Many\\ntelevision programs carry closed captioning. Telephone communication devices are also available.\\nLip-reading or speech-reading is particularly important for people who can hear but have trouble\\ndiscriminating sounds. Most people get useful speech information from lip-reading even without formal\\ntraining. Even people with normal hearing can better understand speech in a noisy place if they can see\\nthe speaker. To use this information the listener must be able to see the speaker's mouth. Health care\\npersonnel should be sensitive to this issue and always position themselves appropriately when speaking\\nto the hearing-impaired. Observing the position of a speaker's lips allows recognition of the consonant\\nbeing spoken, thereby improving speech comprehension in patients with high-frequency hearing loss. Lip-\\nreading may be learned in aural rehabilitation sessions in which a group of age-matched peers meets\\nregularly for instruction and supervised practice in optimizing communication.\\nPeople can gain control over their listening environment by modifying or avoiding difficult situations. For\\nexample, people can visit a restaurant during off-peak hours, when it is quieter. They can ask for a booth,\\nwhich blocks out some extraneous sounds. In direct conversations, people may ask the speaker to face\\nthem. At the beginning of a telephone conversation, they can identify themselves as being hearing-\\nimpaired. At a conference, the \\nspeaker can be asked to use an assistive listening system, which makes\\nuse of either inductive loop, infrared, or FM technology that sends sound through the microphone to a\\npatient's hearing aid.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 47.

American Sign Language\\n(ASL) is the most common version in the US. Other forms include Signed English, Signing Exact English,\\nand Cued Speech.\\nTreatment in Children\\nIn addition to treatment of any cause and the provision of hearing aids, children with hearing loss require\\nsupport of language development with appropriate therapy. Because children must hear language to learn\\nit spontaneously, most deaf children develop language only with special training, ideally beginning as\\nsoon as the hearing loss is identified (an exception would be a deaf child growing up with deaf parents\\nwho are fluent sign language users). Deaf infants must be provided with a form of language input. For\\nexample, a visually based sign language can provide a foundation for later development of oral language\\nif a cochlear implant is not available.\\nIf infants as young as 1 mo have profound bilateral hearing loss and cannot benefit from hearing aids,\\nthey can be a candidate for a cochlear implant. Although cochlear implants allow auditory communication\\nin many children with either congenital or acquired deafness, they are, in the main, more effective in\\nchildren who already have developed language. Children who have postmeningitic deafness develop an\\nossified inner ear; they should receive cochlear implants early to maximize effectiveness. Children whose\\nacoustic nerves have been destroyed by tumors may be helped by implantation of brain stem auditory-\\nstimulating electrodes. Children with cochlear implants may have a slightly greater risk of meningitis than\\nchildren without cochlear implants or adults with cochlear implants.\\nChildren with unilateral deafness should be allowed to use a special system in the classroom, such as an\\nFM auditory trainer. With these systems, the teacher speaks into a microphone that sends signals to a\\nhearing aid in the child\\'s nonaffected ear, improving the child\\'s greatly impaired ability to hear speech\\nagainst a noisy background.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nElderly people typically experience a progressive decrease in hearing (presbycusis). The prevalence of\\nhearing impairment is 30% in people > 65 and is 40 to 50% in those > 75. Nonetheless, hearing loss in\\nthe elderly should be evaluated and not ascribed to aging; elderly patients may have a tumor, a\\nneurologic or autoimmune disorder, or an easily correctible conductive hearing loss. Also, hearing loss in\\nthe elderly facilitates dementia (which can be mitigated by properly correcting hearing loss).\\nPresbycusis:\\n Presbycusis is sensorineural hearing loss that probably results from a combination of age-\\nrelated deterioration and cell death in various components of the hearing system and the effects of\\nchronic noise exposure.\\nHearing loss usually affects the highest frequencies (18 to 20 kHz) early on and gradually affects the\\nlower frequencies; it usually becomes clinically significant when it affects the critical 2- to 4-kHz range at\\nabout age 55 to 65 (sometimes sooner). The loss of high-frequency hearing significantly affects speech\\ncomprehension. Although the loudness of speech seems normal, certain consonant sounds (eg, C, D, K,\\nP, S, T) become hard to hear. Consonant sounds are the most important sounds for speech recognition.\\nFor example, when \"shoe,\" \"blue,\" \"true,\" \"too,\" or \"new\" is spoken, many people with presbycusis can\\nhear the \"oo\" sound, but most have difficulty recognizing which word has been spoken because they\\ncannot distinguish the consonants. This inability to distinguish consonants causes affected people to\\noften think the speaker is mumbling. A speaker attempting to speak louder usually accentuates vowel\\nsounds (which are low frequency), doing little to improve speech recognition. Speech comprehension is\\nparticularly difficult when background noise is present.\\nScreening:\\n A screening tool is often helpful for elderly people because many do not complain of hearing\\nloss.

Inner Ear Disorders\\nIntroduction\\n(See also \\nHearing Loss\\n on p. \\n429\\n.)\\nThe inner ear is in the petrous area of the temporal bone. Within the bone is the osseous labyrinth, which\\nencases the membranous labyrinth. The osseous labyrinth includes the vestibular system (made up of\\nthe semicircular canals and the vestibule) and the cochlea. The vestibular system is responsible for\\nbalance and posture; the cochlea, for hearing.\\nAcoustic Neuroma\\n(Acoustic Neurinoma; 8th Nerve Tumor; Vestibular Schwannoma)\\nAn acoustic neuroma is a Schwann cell-derived tumor of the 8th cranial nerve. Symptoms\\ninclude unilateral hearing loss. Diagnosis is based on audiology and confirmed by MRI.\\nTreatment is surgical removal, stereotactic radiation therapy, or both.\\nAcoustic neuromas almost always arise from the vestibular division of the 8th cranial nerve and account\\nfor about 7% of all intracranial tumors. As the tumor expands, it projects from the internal auditory meatus\\ninto the cerebellopontine angle and compresses the cerebellum and brain stem. The 5th cranial nerve\\nand later the 7th cranial nerve are affected.\\nBilateral acoustic neuromas are common in neurofibromatosis type 2.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSlowly progressive unilateral sensorineural hearing loss is the hallmark symptom. However, the onset of\\nhearing loss may be abrupt, and the degree of impairment may fluctuate. Other early symptoms include\\nunilateral tinnitus, dizziness and dysequilibrium, headache, sensation of pressure or fullness in the ear,\\notalgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and numbness or weakness of the facial nerve.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Audiogram\\n• If positive, gadolinium-enhanced MRI\\nAn audiogram is the first test done (see p. \\n433\\n). It usually reveals an asymmetric sensorineural hearing\\nloss and a greater impairment of speech discrimination than would be expected for the degree of hearing\\nloss. Acoustic reflex decay, the absence of waveforms, and increased latency of the 5th waveform in\\nauditory brain stem response testing are further evidence of a neural lesion. Although not usually required\\nin the routine evaluation of a patient with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss, caloric testing shows\\nmarked vestibular hypoactivity (canal paresis). Such findings indicate the \\nneed for imaging tests,\\npreferably gadolinium-enhanced MRI.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgical removal\\n• Sometimes stereotactic radiation therapy\\nSmall tumors may be removed with microsurgery that preserves the facial nerve. A middle cranial fossa or\\nretrosigmoid approach may preserve remaining hearing; a translabyrinthine route may be used if no\\nuseful hearing remains. Large tumors are removed with the translabyrinthine approach regardless of the\\nremaining hearing. Stereotactic radiation therapy as the sole treatment modality is used predominantly in\\nthe management of small tumors in older patients; its long-term efficacy and adverse effects are under\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 48.

Nausea and nystagmus develop. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment\\ninvolves canalith repositioning maneuvers. Drugs and surgery are rarely, if ever, indicated.\\nBPPV is the most common cause of relapsing otogenic vertigo. It affects people increasingly as they age\\nand can severely affect balance in the elderly, leading to potentially injurious falls.\\nEtiology\\nThe condition is thought to be caused by displacement of otoconial crystals (Ca carbonate crystals\\nnormally embedded in the saccule and utricle). This displaced material stimulates hair cells in the\\nposterior semicircular canal, creating the illusion of motion. Etiologic factors include spontaneous\\ndegeneration of the utricular otolithic membranes, labyrinthine concussion, otitis media, ear surgery,\\nrecent viral infection (eg, viral neuronitis), head trauma, prolonged anesthesia or bed rest, previous\\nvestibular disorders (eg, Meniere's disease), and occlusion of the anterior vestibular artery.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVertigo is triggered when the patient's head moves (eg, when rolling over in bed or bending over to pick\\nup something). Acute vertigo lasts only a few seconds to minutes; episodes tend to peak in the morning\\nand abate throughout the day. Nausea and vomiting may occur, but hearing loss and tinnitus do not.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Gadolinium-enhanced MRI if findings suggest CNS lesion\\nDiagnosis is based on characteristic symptoms, on nystagmus as determined by the Dix-Hallpike\\nmaneuver (a provocative test for positional nystagmus—see \\nSidebar 46-1\\n on p. \\n414\\n), and on absence of\\nother abnormalities on neurologic examination. Such patients require no further testing. Patients with\\nnystagmus suggesting a CNS lesion undergo gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Unlike the positional nystagmus\\nof BPPV, the positional nystagmus of CNS lesions lacks latency, fatigability, and severe subjective\\nsensation and may continue for as long as the position is maintained. Nystagmus caused by a CNS lesion\\nmay be vertical or change direction and, if rotary, is likely to be in the unexpected direction.\\nTreatment\\n• Provocative maneuvers to fatigue symptoms\\n• Canalith repositioning maneuvers\\n• Drug treatment typically not recommended\\nBPPV usually subsides spontaneously in several weeks or months but may continue for months or years.\\nBecause the condition can be long-lasting, drug treatment (like that used in Meniere's disease—see p.\\n445\\n) is not recommended. Often, the adverse effects of drugs worsen dysequilibrium.\\nBecause BPPV is fatigable, one therapy is to have the patient perform provocative maneuvers early in the\\nday in a safe environment. Symptoms are then minimal for the rest of the day.\\nCanalith repositioning maneuvers (Epley maneuver—see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 48.

Both maneuvers can be repeated as necessary.\\n[\\nFig. 48-1.\\n The Epley maneuver.]\\nFor the Semont maneuver, the patient is seated upright in the middle of a stretcher. The patient's head is\\nrotated toward the unaffected ear; this rotation is maintained throughout the maneuver.

Ototoxic drugs should not be used for otic topical application when the tympanic membrane\\nis perforated because the drugs might diffuse into the inner ear.\\nStreptomycin tends to cause more damage to the vestibular portion than to the auditory portion of the\\ninner ear. Although vertigo and difficulty maintaining balance tend to be temporary, severe loss of\\nvestibular sensitivity may persist, sometimes permanently. Loss of vestibular sensitivity causes difficulty\\nwalking, especially in the dark, and oscillopsia (a sensation of bouncing of the environment with each\\nstep). About 4 to 15% of patients who receive 1 g/day for > 1 wk develop measurable hearing loss, which\\nusually occurs after a short latent period (7 to 10 days) and slowly worsens if treatment is continued.\\nComplete, permanent deafness may follow.\\nNeomycin has the greatest cochleotoxic effect of all antibiotics. When large doses are given orally or by\\ncolonic irrigation for intestinal sterilization, enough may be absorbed to affect hearing, particularly if\\nmucosal lesions are present. Neomycin should not be used for wound irrigation or for intrapleural or\\nintraperitoneal irrigation, because massive amounts of the drug may be retained and absorbed, causing\\ndeafness. Kanamycin and amikacin are close to neomycin in cochleotoxic potential and are both capable\\nof causing profound, permanent hearing loss while sparing balance. Viomycin has both cochlear and\\nvestibular toxicity. Gentamicin and tobramycin have vestibular and cochlear toxicity, causing impairment in\\nbalance and hearing.\\nVancomycin can cause hearing loss, especially in the presence of renal insufficiency.\\nChemotherapeutic (antineoplastic) drugs, particularly those containing platinum (cisplatin and\\ncarboplatin), can cause tinnitus and hearing loss. Hearing loss can be profound and permanent, occurring\\nimmediately after the first dose, or can be delayed until several months after completion of treatment.\\nSensorineural hearing loss strikes bilaterally, progresses decrementally, and is permanent.\\nEthacrynic acid and furosemide given IV have caused profound, permanent hearing loss in patients with\\nrenal failure who had been receiving aminoglycoside antibiotics.\\nSalicylates in high doses (> 12 325-mg tablets of aspirin per day) cause temporary hearing loss and\\ntinnitus.

Middle Ear and Tympanic Membrane Disorders\\nIntroduction\\n(See also \\nOtic Tumors\\n on p. \\n493\\n)\\nMiddle ear disorders may be secondary to infection, eustachian tube obstruction, or trauma. Information\\nabout objects placed in the ear and symptoms such as rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, sore throat, URI,\\nallergies, headache, systemic symptoms, and fever aid diagnosis. The appearance of the external\\nauditory canal and tympanic membrane (see\\nFig. 49-1\\n) often yields a diagnosis. The nose, nasopharynx, and oropharynx are examined for signs of\\ninfection and allergy and for evidence of tumors. Middle ear function is evaluated with use of pneumatic\\notoscopy, Weber's tuning fork test and the Rinne tuning fork test, tympanometry, and audiologic tests (see\\np. \\n431\\n).\\nMastoiditis\\nMastoiditis is a bacterial infection of the mastoid air cells, which typically occurs after acute\\notitis media. Symptoms include redness, tenderness, swelling, and fluctuation over the mastoid\\nprocess, with displacement of the pinna. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with antibiotics, such\\nas ceftriaxone, and mastoidectomy if drug therapy is not effective.\\nIn acute purulent otitis media, inflammation often extends into the mastoid antrum and air cells, resulting in\\nfluid accumulation. In a few patients, bacterial infection develops in the collected fluid, typically with the\\nsame organism causing the otitis media; pneumococcus is most common. Mastoid infection can cause\\nosteitis of the septae, leading to coalescence of the air cells. The infection may decompress through a\\nperforation in the tympanic membrane or extend through the lateral mastoid cortex, forming a\\npostauricular subperiosteal abscess. Rarely, it extends centrally, causing a temporal lobe abscess or a\\nseptic thrombosis of the lateral sinus. Occasionally, the infection may erode through the tip of the mastoid\\nand drain into the neck (called a Bezold abscess).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms begin days to weeks after onset of acute otitis media and include fever and persistent,\\nthrobbing otalgia. Nearly all patients have signs of otitis media (see p. \\n448\\n) and purulent otorrhea.\\nRedness, swelling,\\n[\\nFig. 49-1.\\n Tympanic membrane of right ear (A); tympanic cavity with tympanic membrane removed (B).]\\ntenderness, and fluctuation may develop over the mastoid process; the pinna is typically displaced\\nlaterally and inferiorly.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Rarely CT\\nDiagnosis is clinical. CT is rarely necessary but can confirm the diagnosis and show the extent of the\\ninfection. Any middle ear drainage is sent for culture and sensitivity. Tympanocentesis for culture\\npurposes can be done if no spontaneous drainage occurs. CBC and ESR may be abnormal but are\\nneither sensitive nor specific and add little to the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\n• IV ceftriaxone\\nIV antibiotic treatment is initiated immediately with a drug that provides CNS penetration, such as\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 49.

Pain occurs suddenly and persists for 24 to 48 h. Hearing loss and fever suggest a bacterial\\norigin. Diagnosis is based on otoscopic visualization of vesicles on the tympanic membrane.\\nBecause differentiation among a viral, bacterial, and mycoplasmal cause is difficult, antibiotics effective\\nagainst organisms causing otitis media are prescribed (see\\nTable 49-1\\n). Severe, continued pain may be relieved by rupturing the vesicles with a myringotomy knife or\\nby oral analgesics (eg, oxycodone with acetaminophen). Topical analgesics (eg, benzocaine, antipyrine)\\nmay also be beneficial.\\nAcute Otitis Media\\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is a bacterial or viral infection of the middle ear, usually accompanying\\na URI. Symptoms include otalgia, often with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, nausea, vomiting,\\ndiarrhea), especially in the very young. Diagnosis is based on otoscopy. Treatment is with\\nanalgesics and sometimes antibiotics.\\nAlthough AOM can occur at any age, it is most common between ages 3 mo and 3 yr. At this age, the\\neustachian tube is structurally and functionally immature; the angle of the eustachian tube is more\\nhorizontal; and the angle of the tensor veli palatini muscle and the cartilaginous eustachian tube renders\\nthe opening mechanism less efficient.\\nThe etiology may be viral or bacterial. Viral infections are often complicated by secondary bacterial\\ninfection. In neonates, gram-negative enteric bacilli, particularly \\nEscherichia coli\\n, and \\nStaphylococcus\\naureus\\n cause AOM. In older infants and children < 14 yr, the most common organisms are \\nStreptococcus\\npneumoniae\\n, \\nMoraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis\\n, and nontypeable \\nHaemophilus influenzae\\n; less\\ncommon causes are group A \\nβ\\n-hemolytic streptococci and \\nS. aureus\\n. In patients > 14 yr, \\nS. pneumoniae\\n,\\ngroup A \\nβ\\n-hemolytic streptococci, and \\nS. aureus\\n are most common, followed by \\nH. influenzae\\n.\\nIn rare cases, bacterial middle ear infection spreads locally, resulting in acute mastoiditis, petrositis, or\\nlabyrinthitis. Intracranial spread is extremely rare and usually causes meningitis, but brain abscess,\\nsubdural empyema, epidural abscess, lateral sinus thrombosis, or otitic hydrocephalus may occur. Even\\nwith antibiotic treatment, intracranial complications are slow to resolve, especially in immunocompromised\\npatients.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe usual initial symptom is earache, often with hearing loss. Infants may simply be cranky or have\\ndifficulty sleeping. Fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea often occur in young children. Otoscopic\\nexamination can show a bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane (TM) with indistinct landmarks and\\ndisplacement of the light reflex. Air insufflation (pneumatic otoscopy) shows poor mobility of the TM.\\nSpontaneous perforation of the TM causes serosanguineous or purulent otorrhea.\\nSevere headache, confusion, or focal neurologic signs may occur with intracranial spread of infection.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 49.

With\\nnegative middle ear pressure, a transudate of fluid may form in the middle ear. As the pressure differential\\nincreases, ecchymosis and subepithelial hematoma may develop in the mucous membrane of the middle\\near and the TM. A very large pressure differential may cause bleeding into the middle ear, TM rupture,\\nand the development of a perilymph fistula through the oval or round window.\\nSymptoms are severe pain, conductive hearing loss, and, if there is a perilymph fistula, sensory neural\\nloss. Symptoms usually worsen during rapid increase in external air pressures, such as a rapid ascent\\n(eg, during scuba diving) or descent (eg, during air travel). Sensorineural hearing loss or vertigo during\\ndescent suggests the development of a perilymph fistula; the same symptoms during ascent from a deep-\\nsea dive can additionally suggest an air bubble formation in the inner ear.\\nTreatment\\n• Methods to equalize pressure (eg, yawning, swallowing, chewing gum)\\nRoutine self-treatment of pain associated with changing pressure in an aircraft includes chewing gum,\\nattempting to yawn and swallow, blowing against closed nostrils, and using decongestant nasal sprays.\\nIf hearing loss is sensorineural and vertigo is present, a perilymph fistula is suspected and middle ear\\nexploration to close a fistula is considered.

External Ear Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe external ear (pinna and external auditory canal) can be affected by congenital, dermatologic,\\ninfectious, neoplastic, obstructive, and traumatic disorders. Congenital defects are discussed on p.\\n2971\\n. Ear trauma is discussed on p. \\n3231\\n.\\nDermatitis\\nDermatitis is inflammation of the ear canal involving itching and skin changes that are caused\\nby exposure to allergens (contact dermatitis) or are spontaneous occurrences (aural\\neczematoid dermatitis).\\nCommon contact allergens include nickel-containing earrings and numerous beauty products (eg,\\nhairsprays, lotions, hair dye). Aural eczematoid dermatitis is more common among people with a\\npredisposition toward atopy and with other similar dermatitides (eg, seborrhea, psoriasis).\\nBoth contact dermatitis and aural eczematoid dermatitis cause itching, redness, discharge, desquamation,\\nhyperpigmentation, and, sometimes, fissuring. A secondary infection can occur.\\nContact dermatitis requires avoidance or withdrawal of allergic triggers. Trial and error may be needed to\\nidentify the offending agent. Topical corticosteroids (eg, 1% hydrocortisone cream) can decrease\\ninflammation and itching.\\nAural eczematoid dermatitis can be treated with dilute aluminum acetate solution (Burow's solution), which\\ncan be applied as often as required for comfort. Itching and inflammation can be reduced with topical\\ncorticosteroids. If diffuse external otitis ensues, antibiotic therapy may be required (see p. \\n455\\n).\\nExternal Otitis\\nExternal otitis is infection of the ear canal, typically by bacteria. Symptoms include itching, pain,\\nand discharge. Diagnosis is based on inspection. Treatment is with topical drugs, including\\nantibiotics, corticosteroids, and acetic acid or a combination.\\nExternal otitis may manifest as a localized furuncle or as a diffuse infection of the entire canal\\n(generalized or diffuse external otitis). This condition is often called swimmer's ear because it sometimes\\nafflicts people who swim. Malignant external otitis (see p. \\n455\\n) is a severe \\nPseudomonas\\n infection of the\\ntemporal bone and is especially dangerous in diabetics.\\nEtiology\\nDiffuse external otitis is usually caused by bacteria, such as \\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\\n, \\nProteus vulgaris\\n,\\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n, or \\nEscherichia coli\\n. Fungal external otitis (otomycosis), typically caused by\\nAspergillus niger\\n or \\nCandida albicans\\n, is less common. Furuncles usually are due to \\nS. aureus\\n.\\nPredisposing conditions include allergies, psoriasis, eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, decreased canal\\nacidity (possibly due to the repeated presence of water), irritants (eg, hair spray, hair dye), and\\ninadvertent injury to the canal caused by excessive cleaning with cotton swabs or other objects. Attempts\\nto clean the ear canal may push debris and cerumen deeper into the canal; these accumulated\\nsubstances tend to trap water, resulting in skin maceration that sets the stage for bacterial infection.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPatients have itching and pain. Sometimes, a foul-smelling discharge and hearing loss occur if the canal\\nbecomes swollen or filled with purulent debris. Exquisite tenderness accompanies traction of the pinna or\\npressure over the tragus. Otoscopic examination is painful and difficult to conduct. It shows the ear canal\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 50. External Ear Disorders\\n550\"),\n",

They appear as a focal,\\nerythematous swelling.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nDiagnosis is based on inspection. When discharge is copious, external otitis can be difficult to\\ndifferentiate from perforated otitis media; pain with pulling on the pinna may indicate an external otitis.\\nFungal infection is diagnosed by appearance or culture.\\nTreatment\\n• Topical acetic acid and corticosteroids\\n• Sometimes topical antibiotics\\nIn diffuse external otitis, topical antibiotics and corticosteroids are effective. First, the infected debris\\nshould be gently and thoroughly removed from the canal with suction or dry cotton wipes. Mild external\\notitis can be treated by altering the ear canal's pH with 2% acetic acid and by relieving inflammation with\\ntopical hydrocortisone; these are given as 5 drops tid for 7 days. Moderate external otitis requires the\\naddition of an antibacterial solution or suspension, such as neomycin, polymyxin, ciprofloxacin, or\\nofloxacin. When inflammation of the ear canal is relatively severe, an ear wick should be placed into the\\near canal and wetted with the necessary drugs 4 times/day. The wick is left in place for 24 to 72 h, after\\nwhich time the swelling may have receded enough to allow the instillation of drops directly into the canal.\\nSevere external otitis or the presence of cellulitis extending beyond the ear canal may require systemic\\nantibiotics, such as cephalexin 500 mg po tid for 10 days or ciprofloxacin 500 mg po bid for 10 days. An\\nanalgesic, such as an NSAID or even an oral opioid, may be necessary for the first 24 to 48 h. Fungal\\nexternal otitis requires thorough cleaning of the ear canal and application of an antimycotic solution (eg,\\ngentian violet, cresylate acetate, nystatin, clotrimazole). Repeated cleanings and treatments may be\\nneeded.\\nA furuncle, if obviously pointing, should be incised and drained. Incision is of little value, however, if the\\npatient is seen at an early stage. Topical antibiotics are ineffective; oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics\\nshould be given. Analgesics, such as oxycodone with acetaminophen, may be necessary for pain relief.\\nDry heat can also lessen pain and hasten resolution.\\nPrevention\\nExternal otitis often can be prevented by irrigating the ears with a 1:1 mixture of rubbing alcohol and\\nvinegar immediately after swimming. The alcohol helps remove water, and the vinegar alters the pH of the\\ncanal.\\nMalignant External Otitis\\nMalignant external otitis is typically a \\nPseudomonas\\n osteomyelitis of the temporal bone.\\nSoft tissue, cartilage, and bone are all affected. The osteomyelitis spreads along the base of the skull and\\nmay cross the midline.\\nMalignant external otitis occurs mainly in elderly patients with diabetes or in immunocompromised patients\\nand is often initiated by \\nPseudomonas\\n external otitis.

Varying degrees of conductive hearing loss may occur. In severe\\ncases, facial nerve paralysis may ensue.\\nDiagnosis is based on a CT scan of the temporal bone, which may show increased radiodensity in the\\nair-cell system and middle ear radiolucency (demineralization) in some areas. Cultures are done, and the\\near canal is biopsied to differentiate the granulation tissue of this disorder from a malignant tumor.\\nTreatment is with a 6-wk IV course of a fluoroquinolone or an aminoglycoside-semisynthetic penicillin\\ncombination. Extensive bone disease may require more prolonged antibiotic therapy. Careful control of\\ndiabetes is essential. Surgery usually is not necessary.\\nObstructions\\nThe ear canal may be obstructed by cerumen (earwax), insertion of a foreign object, or an\\ninsect. Itching, pain, and temporary conductive hearing loss may result. Most causes of\\nobstruction are readily apparent during otoscopic examination. Treatment is manual removal.\\nCerumen:\\n Cerumen may get pushed further into the ear canal and accumulate during ill-advised\\nattempts to clean the ear canal with cotton swabs, resulting in obstruction. Cerumen solvents (hydrogen\\nperoxide, carbamide peroxide, glycerin, triethanolamine) may be used to soften very hard wax before\\nirrigation or direct removal. However, the prolonged use of these agents may lead to canal skin irritation\\nor allergic reactions. Although cerumen may be removed by irrigation, rolling the cerumen out of the ear\\ncanal with a blunt curet or loop or removing it with a suction tip (eg, Baron, size 7 French) is quicker,\\nneater, safer, and more comfortable for the patient. Irrigation is contraindicated if the patient has a history\\nof otorrhea or perforation of the tympanic membrane; water entering the middle ear through a perforation\\nmay exacerbate chronic otitis media.\\nForeign bodies:\\n Foreign bodies are common, particularly among children, who often insert objects,\\nparticularly beads, erasers, and beans, into the ear canal. Foreign bodies may remain unnoticed until they\\nprovoke an inflammatory response, causing pain, itching, infection, and foul-smelling, purulent drainage. A\\nforeign body in the ear canal is best removed by reaching behind it and rolling it out with a blunt hook.\\nForceps tend to push smooth objects deeper into the canal. Unfortunately, a foreign body lying medial to\\nthe isthmus (the bony cartilaginous junction of the external auditory canal) is difficult to remove without\\ninjuring the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain. Metal and glass beads can sometimes be removed\\nby irrigation, but hygroscopic foreign bodies (eg, beans or other vegetable matter) swell when water is\\nadded, complicating removal. A general anesthetic may be needed when a child cannot remain still or\\nwhen removal is difficult, threatening injury to the tympanic membrane or ossicles. Further, if manipulating\\na presumed foreign object results in bleeding, immediate otolaryngologic consultation should be sought.\\nBleeding may indicate a mucosal polyp originating in the middle ear, which may be attached to the\\nossicles or facial nerve.\\nInsects in the canal are most annoying while alive. Filling the canal with viscous lidocaine kills the insect,\\nwhich provides immediate relief and allows the immobilized insect to be removed with forceps.\\nPerichondritis\\nPerichondritis is infection of the perichondrium of the pinna in which pus accumulates between\\nthe cartilage and the perichondrium.\\nCauses of perichondritis include trauma, insect bites, body piercings, and incision of superficial infections\\nof the pinna. Because the cartilage's blood supply is provided by the perichondrium, separation of the\\nperichondrium from both sides of the cartilage may lead to avascular necrosis and a deformed pinna.\\nSeptic necrosis may also ensue, often with infection by gram-negative bacilli. Symptoms include redness,\\npain, and swelling. The course of perichondritis tends to be indolent, long-term, and destructive.\\nThe affected area is incised, and a drain is left in place for 24 to 72 h. Systemic antibiotics are initiated\\nwith an aminoglycoside and semisynthetic penicillin.

Approach to the Patient With Nasal and Pharyngeal Symptoms\\nIntroduction\\nThe nose and pharynx (consisting of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) may be affected by\\ninflammation, infection, trauma, tumors, and several miscellaneous conditions.\\nAnatomy\\nThroat:\\n The uvula hangs in the midline at the far end of the soft palate. It varies greatly in length. A long\\nuvula and loose or excess velopharyngeal tissue may cause snoring and occasionally contribute to\\nobstructive sleep apnea.\\nTonsils and adenoids are patches of lymphoid tissue surrounding the posterior pharynx in an area termed\\nWaldeyer's ring. Their role is to combat infection.\\nThe larynx is discussed in \\nCh. 54\\n.\\nNose:\\n The nasal cavity is covered with a highly vascular mucosa that warms and humidifies incoming air.\\nEach lateral wall of the cavity has 3 turbinates, which are bony shelves that increase the surface area,\\nthereby allowing more effective heat and moisture exchange. Nasal mucus traps incoming particulate\\nmatter. The space between the middle and inferior turbinate is the middle meatus, into which the maxillary\\nand most of the ethmoid sinuses drain. Polyps may develop between the turbinates, often in association\\nwith asthma, allergy, aspirin use, and cystic fibrosis.\\nSinuses:\\n The paranasal sinuses are mucus-lined bony cavities that connect to the nasopharynx. The 4\\ntypes are maxillary, frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid sinuses. They are located in the facial and cranial\\nbones (see\\nFig. 51-1\\n). The physiologic role of the sinuses is unclear.\\n[\\nFig. 51-1.\\n Paranasal sinuses.]\\nEvaluation\\nExamination of the nose and pharynx is part of every general physical examination.\\nHistory:\\n General information includes use of alcohol or tobacco (both major risk factors for head and\\nneck cancer) and systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss. Oropharyngeal symptoms include\\npain, ulcers, and difficulty swallowing or speaking. Nasal and sinus symptoms include presence and\\nduration of congestion, discharge, or bleeding.\\nPhysical examination:\\n Most physicians use a head-mounted light. However, because the light cannot\\nbe precisely aligned on the axis of vision, it is difficult to avoid shadowing in narrow areas (eg, nasal\\ncavity). Better illumination results with a head-mounted convex mirror; the physician looks through a hole\\nin the center of the mirror, so the illumination is always on-axis. The head mirror reflects light from a\\nsource (any incandescent light) placed behind the patient and slightly to one side and requires practice to\\nuse effectively.\\nThe nose is examined using a nasal speculum, which is held so that the 2 blades open in an\\nanteroposterior (or slightly oblique) direction and do not press against the septum. The physician notes\\ncrusting, discharge, septal deviation, or perforation; whether mucosa is erythematous, boggy, or swollen;\\nand presence of polyps. The skin over the frontal and maxillary sinuses is examined for erythema and\\ntenderness, suggesting sinus inflammation.\\nIf necessary, the nasopharynx and hypopharynx can be examined with mirrors, which should be warmed\\nbefore use to avoid fogging. A small mirror is used for the nasopharynx. It is held just below the uvula,\\nangling upward; the tongue is pushed down with a tongue blade. A larger mirror is used for the\\nhypopharynx and larynx. The tongue is retracted by grasping it with a gauze pad, and the mirror is placed\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 51.

A topical anesthetic (eg, lidocaine 4%) is sprayed in the nose\\nand throat, and the nose is also sprayed with a decongestant (eg, phenylephrine 0.5%). After several\\nminutes, the scope is gently passed through the nares, and the nasal cavity, hypopharynx, and larynx are\\ninspected.\\nNeck examination consists of inspection and palpation for masses. If masses are found, the physician\\nnotes whether they are tender; fluctuant, firm, or stony hard; and movable or fixed. Masses caused by\\ninfection are tender and mobile; cancers tend to be nontender, hard, and fixed. Particular attention is paid\\nto the cervical lymph nodes and thyroid and parotid glands.\\nEpistaxis\\nEpistaxis is nose bleeding. Bleeding can range from a trickle to a strong flow, and the\\nconsequences can range from a minor annoyance to life-threatening hemorrhage. Swallowed\\nblood is a gastric irritant, so patients also may describe vomiting blood.\\nPathophysiology\\nMost nasal bleeding is anterior, originating from a plexus of vessels in the anteroinferior septum\\n(Kiesselbach's area).\\nLess common but more serious are posterior nosebleeds, which originate in the posterior septum\\noverlying the vomer bone, or laterally on the inferior or middle turbinate. Posterior nosebleeds tend to\\noccur in patients who have preexisting atherosclerotic vessels or bleeding disorders and have undergone\\nnasal or sinus surgery.\\nEtiology\\nThe most common causes of epistaxis are\\n• Local trauma (eg, nose blowing and picking)\\n• Drying of the nasal mucosa\\nThere are a number of less common causes (see\\nTable 51-1\\n). Hypertension may contribute to the persistence of a nosebleed that has already begun but is\\nunlikely to be the sole etiology.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: History of present illness\\n should try to determine which side began bleeding first; although\\nmajor epistaxis quickly involves both nares, most patients can localize the initial flow to one side, which\\nfocuses the physical examination. Also, the duration of bleeding should be established, as well as any\\ntriggers (eg, sneezing, nose blowing, picking) and attempts by the patient to stop the bleeding. Important\\nassociated symptoms prior to onset include symptoms of a URI, sensation of nasal obstruction, and nasal\\nor facial pain. The time and number of previous nose-bleeding episodes and their resolution should be\\nidentified.\\n[\\nTable 51-1.\\n Some Causes of Epistaxis]\\nReview of systems\\n should ask about symptoms of excessive bleeding, including easy bruising; bloody\\nor tarry stools; hemoptysis; blood in urine; and excess bleeding with toothbrushing, phlebotomy, or minor\\ntrauma.\\nPast medical history\\n should note presence of known bleeding disorders (including a family history) and\\nconditions associated with defects in platelets or coagulation, particularly cancer, cirrhosis, HIV, and\\npregnancy.

A neck mass may be painless or painful depending on the cause. When a neck mass is\\npainless, much time may pass before patients seek medical care.\\nEtiology\\nThere are many causes of neck mass, including infectious, cancerous, and congenital causes (see\\nTable 51-3\\n).\\nThe most common causes in younger patients include the following:\\n• Reactive adenitis\\n• Primary bacterial lymph node infection\\n• Systemic infections\\n[\\nTable 51-3.\\n Some Causes of Neck Mass]\\nReactive adenitis occurs in response to viral or bacterial infection somewhere in the oropharynx. Some\\nsystemic infections (eg, mononucleosis, HIV, TB) cause cervical lymph node enlargement—usually\\ngeneralized rather than isolated.\\nCongenital disorders may cause a neck mass, typically longstanding. The most common are thyroglossal\\nduct cysts, branchial cleft cysts, and dermoid or sebaceous cysts.\\nCancerous masses are more common among older patients but may occur in younger ones. These\\nmasses may represent a local primary tumor or lymph node involvement from a local, regional, or distant\\nprimary cancer. About 60% of supraclavicular triangle masses are metastases from distant primary sites.\\nElsewhere in the neck, 80% of cancerous cervical adenopathy originates in the upper respiratory or\\nalimentary tract. Likely sites of origin are the posterior-lateral border of the tongue and the floor of the\\nmouth followed by the nasopharynx, palatine tonsil, laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, and hypopharynx,\\nincluding the pyriform sinuses.\\nThe thyroid gland may enlarge in various disorders, including simple nontoxic goiter, subacute thyroiditis,\\nand, less often, thyroid cancer.\\nEvaluation\\nHistory: History of present illness\\n should note how long the mass has been present and whether it is\\npainful. Important associated acute symptoms include sore throat, URI symptoms, and toothache.\\nReview of systems\\n should ask about difficulty swallowing or speaking and symptoms of chronic\\ndisease (eg, fever, weight loss, malaise). Regional and distant cancers causing metastases to the neck\\noccasionally cause symptoms in their system of origin (eg, cough in lung cancer, swallowing difficulty in\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 51.

Risk factors for\\ncancer are assessed, including consumption of alcohol or use of tobacco (particularly snuff or chewing\\ntobacco), ill-fitting dental appliances, and chronic oral candidiasis. Poor oral hygiene also may be a risk.\\nPhysical examination:\\n The neck mass is palpated to determine consistency (ie, whether soft and\\nfluctuant, rubbery, or hard) and presence and degree of tenderness. Whether the mass is freely mobile or\\nappears fixed to the skin or underlying tissue also needs to be determined.\\nThe scalp, ears, nasal cavities, oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx are closely\\ninspected for signs of infection and any other visible lesions. Teeth are percussed to detect the exquisite\\ntenderness of root infection. The base of the tongue, floor of the mouth, and the thyroid and salivary\\nglands are palpated for masses.\\nThe breasts and prostate gland are palpated for masses, and the spleen is palpated for enlargement.\\nStool is checked for occult blood, suggestive of a GI cancer.\\nOther lymph nodes are palpated (eg, axillary, inguinal).\\nRed flags:\\n The following findings are of particular concern:\\n• Hard, fixed mass\\n• Older patient\\n• Presence of oropharyngeal lesions (other than simple pharyngitis or dental infection)\\n• A history of persistent hoarseness or dysphagia\\nInterpretation of findings:\\n Important differentiating factors for a neck mass (see also \\nTable 51-3\\n)\\ninclude acuity, pain and tenderness, and consistency and mobility.\\nA new mass (ie, developing over only a few days), particularly after symptoms of a URI or pharyngitis,\\nsuggests benign reactive lymphadenopathy. An acute tender mass suggests lymphadenitis or an infected\\ndermoid cyst.\\nA chronic mass in younger patients suggests a cyst. A non-midline mass in older patients, particularly\\nthose with risk factors, should be considered cancer until proven otherwise; a midline mass is likely of\\nthyroid origin (benign or malignant).\\nPain, tenderness, or both in the mass suggest inflammation (particularly infectious), whereas a painless\\nmass suggests a cyst or tumor. A hard, fixed, nontender mass suggests cancer, whereas rubbery\\nconsistency and mobility suggest otherwise.\\nGeneralized adenopathy and splenomegaly suggest infectious mononucleosis or a lymphoreticular\\ncancer. Generalized adenopathy alone may suggest HIV infection, particularly in those with risk factors.\\nRed and white mucosal patches (erythroplakia and leukoplakia) in the oropharynx may be malignant\\nlesions responsible for the neck mass.\\nDifficulty swallowing may be noted with thyroid enlargement or cancer originating in various sites in the\\nneck.

Dysfunction of one often disturbs the other. Disorders of smell and taste\\nare rarely incapacitating or life threatening, so they often do not receive close medical attention, although\\ntheir effect on quality of life can be severe.\\nTaste:\\n Although abnormal taste sensations may be due to mental disorders, local causes should always\\nbe sought. Glossopharyngeal and facial nerve integrity can be determined by testing taste on both sides\\nof the dorsum of the tongue with sugar, salt, vinegar (acid), and quinine (bitter).\\nDrying of the oral mucosa caused by heavy smoking, Sjogren's syndrome, radiation therapy of the head\\nand neck, or desquamation of the tongue can impair taste, and various drugs (eg, those with\\nanticholinergic properties and vincristine) alter taste. In all instances, the gustatory receptors are diffusely\\ninvolved. When limited to one side of the tongue (eg, in Bell's palsy), ageusia (loss of the sense of taste)\\nis rarely noticed.\\nSmell:\\n The inability to detect certain odors, such as gas or smoke, may be dangerous, and several\\nsystemic and intracranial disorders should be excluded before dismissing symptoms as harmless.\\nWhether brain stem disease (involvement of the nucleus solitarius) can cause disorders of smell and\\ntaste is uncertain, because other neurologic manifestations usually take precedence.\\nAnosmia (loss of the sense of smell) is probably the most common abnormality. Hyperosmia (increased\\nsensitivity to odors) usually reflects a neurotic or histrionic personality but can occur intermittently with\\nseizure disorders. Dysosmia (disagreeable or distorted sense of smell) may occur with infection of the\\nnasal sinuses, partial damage to the olfactory bulbs, or mental depression. Some cases, accompanied by\\na disagreeable taste, result from poor dental hygiene. Uncinate epilepsy can produce brief, vivid,\\nunpleasant olfactory hallucinations. Hyposmia (diminished sense of smell) and hypogeusia (diminished\\nsense of taste) can follow acute influenza, usually temporarily.\\nRarely, idiopathic dysgeusia (distorted sense of taste), hypogeusia, and dysosmia respond to zinc\\nsupplementation.\\nAnosmia\\nAnosmia is complete loss of smell. Hyposmia is partial loss of smell. Most patients with anosmia have\\nnormal perception of salty, sweet, sour, and bitter substances but lack flavor discrimination, which largely\\ndepends on olfaction. Therefore, they often complain of losing the sense of taste (ageusia) and of not\\nenjoying food. If unilateral, anosmia is often unrecognized.\\nEtiology\\nAnosmia occurs when intranasal swelling or other obstruction prevents odors from gaining access to the\\nolfactory area; when the olfactory neuroepithelium is destroyed; or when the olfactory nerve fila, bulbs,\\ntracts, or central connections are destroyed (see\\nTable 51-4\\n).\\nMajor causes include\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 51.

Sialadenitis is\\nmost common in the parotid gland and typically occurs in patients in their 50s and 60s, in chronically ill\\npatients with xerostomia, in those with Sjogren's syndrome, and in those who have had radiation therapy\\nto the oral cavity. Teenagers and young adults with anorexia are also prone to this disorder. The most\\ncommon causative organism is \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n; others include streptococci, coliforms, and\\nvarious anaerobic bacteria.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nFever, chills, and unilateral pain and swelling develop. The gland is firm and diffusely tender, with\\nerythema and edema of the overlying skin. Pus can often be expressed from the duct by compressing the\\naffected gland and should be cultured. Focal enlargement may indicate an abscess.\\nDiagnosis\\nCT, ultrasound, and MRI can confirm sialadenitis or abscess that is not obvious clinically, although MRI\\nmay miss an obstructing stone.\\nTreatment\\n• Antistaphylococcal antibiotics\\n• Local measures (eg, sialagogues, warm compresses)\\nInitial treatment is with antibiotics active against \\nS. aureus\\n (eg, dicloxacillin, 250 mg po qid, a 1st-\\ngeneration cephalosporin, or clindamycin), modified according to culture results. With the increasing\\nprevalence of methicillin-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n, especially among the elderly living in extended-care nursing\\nfacilities, vancomycin is often required. Hydration, sialagogues (eg, lemon juice, hard candy, or some\\nother substance that triggers saliva flow), warm compresses, gland massage, and good oral hygiene are\\nalso important. Abscesses require drainage. Occasionally, a superficial parotidectomy or submandibular\\ngland excision is indicated for patients with chronic or relapsing sialadenitis.\\nOther Salivary Gland Infections\\nMumps often cause parotid swelling (see\\nTable 155-1\\n on p. \\n1462\\n). Patients with HIV infection often have parotid enlargement secondary to one or\\nmore lymphoepithelial cysts. Cat-scratch disease caused by \\nBartonella\\n infection often invades periparotid\\nlymph nodes and may infect the parotid glands by contiguous spread. Although cat-scratch disease is\\nself-limited, antibiotic therapy is often provided, and incision and drainage are necessary if an abscess\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 52.

Diagnosis is made clinically or with CT, ultrasonography, or sialography.\\nTreatment involves stone expression with saliva stimulants, manual manipulation, a probe, or\\nsurgery.\\nThe major salivary glands are the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Stones in the\\nsalivary glands are most common among adults. Eighty percent of stones originate in the submandibular\\nglands and obstruct Wharton's duct. Most of the rest originate in the parotid glands and block Stensen's\\nduct. Only about 1% originate in the sublingual glands. Multiple stones occur in about 25% of patients.\\nEtiology\\nMost salivary stones are composed of Ca phosphate with small amounts of Mg and carbonate. Patients\\nwith gout may have uric acid stones. Stone formation requires a nidus on which salts can precipitate\\nduring salivary stasis. Stasis occurs in patients who are debilitated, dehydrated, have reduced food\\nintake, or take anticholinergics. Persisting or recurrent stones predispose to infection of the involved\\ngland (sialadenitis—see p. \\n469\\n).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nObstructing stones cause glandular swelling and pain, particularly after eating, which stimulates saliva\\nflow. Symptoms may subside after a few hours. Relief may coincide with a gush of saliva. Some stones\\ncause intermittent or no symptoms. If a stone is lodged distally, it may be visible or palpable at the duct's\\noutlet.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Sometimes imaging (eg, CT, ultrasonography, sialography)\\nIf a stone is not apparent on examination, the patient can be given a sialagogue (eg, lemon juice, hard\\ncandy, or some other substance that triggers saliva flow).

Although not a true abscess, it resembles one clinically and is treated similarly.\\nThe condition usually develops from an odontogenic infection, especially of the 2nd and 3rd mandibular\\nmolars, or as an extension of peritonsillar cellulitis. Contributing factors may include poor dental hygiene,\\ntooth extractions, and trauma (eg, fractures of the mandible, lacerations of the floor of the mouth).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nEarly manifestations are pain in any involved teeth, with severe, tender, localized submental and\\nsublingual induration. Board-like firmness of the floor of the mouth and brawny induration of the\\nsuprahyoid soft tissues may develop rapidly. Drooling, trismus, dysphagia, stridor caused by laryngeal\\nedema, and elevation of the posterior tongue against the palate may be present.

A dirty gray, thick, tough membrane that bleeds if peeled away\\nindicates diphtheria (rare in the US).\\nBecause GABHS requires antibiotics, it must be diagnosed early. Criteria for testing are controversial.\\nMany authorities recommend testing with a rapid antigen test or culture for all children. Rapid antigen\\ntests are specific but not sensitive and may need to be followed by a culture, which is about 90% specific\\nand 90% sensitive. In adults, many authorities recommend using the following 4 criteria:\\n• History of fever\\n• Tonsillar exudates\\n• Absence of cough\\n• Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy\\nPatients who meet 1 or no criteria are unlikely to have GABHS and should not be tested. Patients who\\nmeet 2 criteria can be tested. Patients who meet 3 or 4 criteria can be tested or treated empirically for\\nGABHS.\\nTreatment\\n• Symptomatic treatment\\n• Antibiotics for GABHS\\n• Tonsillectomy considered for recurrent GABHS\\nSupportive treatments include analgesia, hydration, and rest. Penicillin V is usually considered the drug of\\nchoice for GABHS tonsillopharyngitis; dose is 250 mg po bid for 10 days for patients < 27 kg and 500 mg\\nfor those > 27 kg (see also p. \\n1234\\n). Amoxicillin is effective and more palatable if a liquid preparation is\\nrequired. If adherence is a concern, a single dose of benzathine penicillin 1.2 million units IM (600,000\\nunits for children ≤ 27 kg) is effective. Other oral drugs include macrolides for patients allergic to\\npenicillin, a 1st-generation cephalosporin, and clindamycin.\\nTreatment may be started immediately or delayed until culture results are known.

Posterior abscesses may involve\\nstructures within the carotid sheath, possibly causing rigors, high fever, bacteremia, neurologic deficits,\\nand massive hemorrhage caused by carotid artery rupture.\\nDiagnosis\\n• CT\\nDiagnosis is suspected in patients with poorly defined deep neck infection or other typical symptoms and\\nis confirmed by using contrast-enhanced CT.\\nTreatment\\n• Broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone, clindamycin)\\n• Surgical drainage\\nTreatment may require airway control. Parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone,\\nclindamycin) and surgical drainage are generally needed. Posterior abscesses are drained externally\\nthrough the submaxillary fossa. Anterior abscesses can often be drained through an intra-oral incision.\\nSeveral days of parenteral culture-determined antibiotics are required after drainage, followed by 10 to 14\\ndays of oral antibiotics. Occasionally, small abscesses can be treated with IV antibiotics alone.\\nEpiglottitis\\n(Supraglottitis)\\nEpiglottitis is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection of the epiglottis and surrounding tissues\\nthat may lead to sudden respiratory obstruction and death. Symptoms include severe sore\\nthroat, dysphagia, high fever, drooling, and inspiratory stridor. Diagnosis requires direct\\nvisualization of the supraglottic structures, which is not to be done until full respiratory support\\nis available. Treatment includes airway protection and antibiotics.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 52. Oral & Pharyngeal Disorders\\n575'),\n",

Bacitracin or mupirocin ointment applied topically bid for 14 days is effective.\\nFuruncles\\n of the nasal vestibule are usually staphylococcal; they may develop into spreading cellulitis of\\nthe tip of the nose. Systemic antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg, cephalexin 500 mg po qid) are given and\\nwarm compresses and topical mupirocin are applied. Furuncles are incised and drained to prevent local\\nthrombophlebitis and subsequent cavernous sinus thrombosis.\\nForeign Bodies\\nNasal foreign bodies are found occasionally in young children, the intellectually impaired, and psychiatric\\npatients. Common objects pushed into the nose include beads, beans, seeds, nuts, insects, and button\\nbatteries (which may cause chemical burns). When mineral salts are deposited on a long-retained foreign\\nbody, the object is called a rhinolith.\\nA nasal foreign body is suspected in any patient with a unilateral, foul-smelling, bloody, purulent\\nrhinorrhea. Diagnosis is often made through another party's observation of the item being pushed into the\\nnose or through visualization with a nasal speculum.\\nNasal foreign bodies can sometimes be removed in the office with a nasal speculum and Hartmann's\\nnasal forceps. Pretreatment with topical phenylephrine may aid visualization and removal. To avoid\\npushing a slippery, round object deeper, it is better to reach behind the object with the bent tip of a blunt\\nprobe and pull it forward. Sometimes, general anesthesia is necessary if a rhinolith has formed or if the\\nforeign body may be displaced dorsally and then aspirated, resulting in airway obstruction.\\nNasal Polyps\\nNasal polyps are fleshy outgrowths of the nasal mucosa that form at the site of dependent\\nedema in the lamina propria of the mucous membrane, usually around the ostia of the maxillary\\nsinuses (see\\nPlate 2\\n).\\nAllergic rhinitis, acute and chronic infections, and cystic fibrosis all predispose to the formation of nasal\\npolyps.

The cause is usually viral, although irritants can cause it. Diagnosis\\nis usually clinical. Treatment includes humidification of room air, sympathomimetic amines, and\\nantihistamines. Bacterial superinfection requires appropriate antibiotic treatment.\\nThere are several forms of rhinitis.\\nAcute rhinitis:\\n This form of rhinitis, manifesting with edema and vasodilation of the nasal mucous\\nmembrane, rhinorrhea, and obstruction, is usually the result of a common cold (see p. \\n1404\\n); other\\ncauses include streptococcal, pneumococcal, and staphylococcal infections.\\nChronic rhinitis:\\n This form of rhinitis is generally a prolongation of subacute inflammatory or infectious\\nviral rhinitis but may also occur in syphilis, TB, rhinoscleroma, rhinosporidiosis, leishmaniasis,\\nblastomycosis, histoplasmosis, and leprosy—all of which are characterized by granuloma formation and\\ndestruction of soft tissue, cartilage, and bone. Nasal obstruction, purulent rhinorrhea, and frequent\\nbleeding result. Rhinoscleroma causes progressive nasal obstruction from indurated inflammatory tissue\\nin the lamina propria. Rhinosporidiosis is characterized by bleeding polyps. Both low humidity and\\nairborne irritants can result in chronic rhinitis.\\nAtrophic rhinitis:\\n This form of rhinitis results in atrophy and sclerosis of mucous membrane; the mucous\\nmembrane changes from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium,\\nand the lamina propria is reduced in amount and vascularity. Atrophic rhinitis is associated with advanced\\nage, Wegener's granulomatosis, and iatrogenically induced excessive nasal tissue extirpation. Although\\nthe exact etiology is unknown, bacterial infection frequently plays a role. Nasal mucosal atrophy often\\noccurs in the elderly.\\nVasomotor rhinitis:\\n This form of rhinitis is a chronic condition in which intermittent vascular\\nengorgement of the nasal mucous membrane leads to watery rhinorrhea and sneezing. Etiology is\\nuncertain, and no allergy can be identified. A dry atmosphere seems to aggravate the condition.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute rhinitis results in cough, low-grade fever, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. Symptoms\\nand signs of chronic rhinitis are similar but may include purulent rhinorrhea and bleeding.\\nAtrophic rhinitis results in abnormal patency of the nasal cavities, crust formation, anosmia, and epistaxis\\nthat may be recurrent and severe.\\nVasomotor rhinitis results in sneezing and watery rhinorrhea. The turgescent mucous membrane varies\\nfrom bright red to purple. The condition is marked by periods of remission and exacerbation. Vasomotor\\nrhinitis is differentiated from specific viral and bacterial infections of the nose by the lack of purulent\\nexudate and crusting.

Decongestants also may relieve symptoms of acute bacterial rhinitis and\\nchronic rhinitis, whereas an underlying bacterial infection requires culture or biopsy, pathogen\\nidentification, antibiotic sensitivities, and appropriate antimicrobial treatment.\\nTreatment of atrophic rhinitis is directed at reducing the crusting and eliminating the odor with topical\\nantibiotics (eg, bacitracin), topical or systemic estrogens, and vitamins A and D. Occluding or reducing the\\npatency of the nasal cavities surgically decreases the crusting caused by the drying effect of air flowing\\nover the atrophic mucous membrane.\\nTreatment of vasomotor rhinitis is by trial and error and is not always satisfactory. Patients benefit from\\nhumidified air, which may be provided by a humidified central heating system or a vaporizer in the\\nworkroom or bedroom. Systemic sympathomimetic amines (eg, for adults, pseudoephedrine 30 mg po q 4\\nto 6 h prn) relieve symptoms but are not recommended for long-term use.

Symptomatic septal deviation causes nasal obstruction and\\npredisposes the patient to sinusitis (particularly if the deviation obstructs the ostium of a paranasal sinus)\\nand to epistaxis due to drying air currents. Other symptoms may include facial pain, headaches, and noisy\\nnight breathing. Septal deviation is usually evident on examination, although a flashlight and examination\\nof the anterior nasal passage may not be sufficient. Treatment consists of septoplasty (septal\\nreconstruction).\\nSeptal ulcers and perforations\\n may result from nasal surgery; repeated trauma, such as chronic nose\\npicking; cosmetic piercing; toxic exposures (eg, acids, chromium, phosphorus, copper vapor); chronic\\ncocaine use; chronic nasal spray use (including corticosteroids and OTC phenylephrine or oxymetazoline\\nsprays); transnasal O\\n2\\n use; or diseases such as TB, syphilis, leprosy, SLE, and Wegener's\\ngranulomatosis.

The resulting relative negative \\npressure in the\\nsinus (vacuum sinusitis) is painful. If the vacuum is maintained, a transudate from the mucous membrane\\ndevelops and fills the sinus; the transudate serves as a medium for bacteria that enter the sinus through\\nthe ostium or through a spreading cellulitis or thrombophlebitis in the lamina propria of the mucous\\nmembrane. An outpouring of serum and leukocytes to combat the infection results, and painful positive\\npressure develops in the obstructed sinus. The mucous membrane becomes hyperemic and edematous.\\nChronic sinusitis\\n may be exacerbated by gram-negative bacilli or anaerobic micro-organisms. In a few\\ncases, chronic maxillary sinusitis is secondary to dental infection or exposure to environmental pollution.\\nFungal infections (\\nAspergillus\\n, \\nSporothrix\\n, \\nPseudallescheria\\n) tend to strike the immunocompromised\\npatient, whereas hospital-acquired infections complicate cystic fibrosis, nasogastric and nasotracheal\\nintubation, and debilitated patients. Typical organisms include \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n, \\nKlebsiella\\npneumoniae\\n, \\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\\n, \\nProteus mirabilis\\n, and \\nEnterobacter\\n.\\nAllergic fungal sinusitis\\n is characterized by diffuse nasal congestion, markedly viscid nasal secretions,\\nand, often, nasal polyps. It is an allergic response to the presence of topical fungi, often \\nAspergillus\\n, and\\nis not caused by an invasive infection.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute and chronic sinusitis cause similar symptoms and signs, including purulent rhinorrhea, pressure\\nand pain in the face, nasal congestion and obstruction, hyposmia, halitosis, and productive cough\\n(especially at night). Often the pain is more severe in acute sinusitis. The area over the affected sinus\\nmay be tender, swollen, and erythematous. Maxillary sinusitis causes pain in the maxillary area,\\ntoothache, and frontal headache. Frontal sinusitis causes pain in the frontal area and frontal headache.\\nEthmoid sinusitis causes pain behind and between the eyes, frontal headache often described as\\nsplitting, periorbital cellulitis, and tearing. Pain caused by sphenoid sinusitis is less well localized and is\\nreferred to the frontal or occipital area. Malaise may be present.

Laryngeal Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe larynx contains the vocal cords and serves as the opening to the tracheobronchial tree. Laryngeal\\ndisorders include various benign and malignant tumors, contact ulcers, granulomas, laryngitis,\\nlaryngoceles, spasmodic dysphonia, vocal cord paralysis, and vocal cord polyps and nodules. For acute\\nlaryngotracheobronchitis, see \\nCroup\\n on p. \\n2879\\n.\\nLaryngeal cancer is discussed on p. \\n489\\n.\\nMost laryngeal disorders cause dysphonia, which is impairment of the voice (see \\nSidebar 54-1\\n). A\\npersistent change in the voice (eg, > 3 wk) requires visualization of the vocal cords, including their\\nmobility. Although the voice changes with advancing age, becoming breathy and aperiodic, acute or\\nprominent changes in the elderly should not be presumed to result from aging, and evaluation is required.\\nThe voice should be assessed and recorded, particularly if surgical procedures are planned. Examination\\nof the larynx includes external inspection and palpation of the neck and internal visualization of the\\nepiglottis, false cords, true cords, arytenoids, pyriform sinuses, and subglottic region below the cords.\\nInternal visualization is accomplished by either indirect mirror examination (see\\nFig. 54-1\\n) or direct flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy in an outpatient setting with a topical anesthetic. Rigid\\nlaryngoscopy with the patient under general anesthesia allows for biopsy when necessary or assessment\\nof passive mobility of the vocal cords when immobilized by either paralysis or fixation.\\nSidebar 54-1 The Professional Voice\\nPeople who use their voice professionally for public speaking and singing often experience voice\\ndisorders manifesting as hoarseness or breathiness, lowered vocal pitch, vocal fatigue, nonproductive\\ncough, persistent throat clearing, and/or throat ache. These symptoms often have benign causes, such\\nas vocal nodules, vocal fold edema, polyps, or granulomas. Such disorders are usually caused by vocal\\nfold hyperfunction (excessive laryngeal muscular tension when speaking) and possibly laryngopharyngeal\\nreflux.\\nTreatment in most cases includes the following:\\n• Voice evaluation by a speech pathologist or experienced physician, including, when available, use of a\\ncomputer-assisted program to assess pitch and intensity and to determine parameters of vocal\\nacoustics\\n• Behavioral treatment (decreasing musculoskeletal laryngeal tension when speaking) using the same\\ncomputer program for visual and auditory biofeedback\\n• A vocal hygiene program to eliminate vocally abusive behaviors, such as excessive loudness, long\\nduration, vocal tension, and habitual throat clearing\\n• An antireflux regimen, when appropriate\\n• Adequate hydration to promote an adequate glottal mucosal wave\\n• Diet modification before vocal performances, which may include avoidance of dairy products, caffeine,\\nand ambient tobacco smoke and other inhaled irritants\\nBenign Tumors\\nBenign laryngeal tumors include juvenile papillomas hemangiomas, fibromas, chondromas, myxomas, and\\nneurofibromas. They may appear in any part of the larynx. Symptoms include hoarseness, breathy voice,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 54. Laryngeal Disorders\\n584'),\n",

They may also occur after\\nendotracheal intubation if an oversized tube erodes the mucosa overlying the cartilaginous vocal\\nprocesses. Gastroesophageal reflux may also cause or aggravate contact ulcers. Symptoms include\\nvarying degrees of hoarseness and mild pain with phonation and swallowing. Biopsy to exclude\\ncarcinoma or TB is important. Prolonged ulceration leads to nonspecific granulomas that also cause\\nvarying degrees of hoarseness.\\nTreatment consists of ≥ 6 wk of voice rest. Patients must recognize the limitations of their voice and learn\\nto adjust their postrecovery vocal activities to avoid recurrence. Granulomas tend to recur after surgical\\nremoval. Risk of recurrence is reduced through vigorous treatment of gastroesophageal reflux (see p.\\n125\\n). Suppression of bacterial flora by antibiotics during postoperative healing is also recommended.\\nLaryngitis\\nLaryngitis is inflammation of the larynx, usually the result of a virus or overuse. The result is\\nacute change in the voice, with decreased volume and hoarseness. Diagnosis is based on\\nclinical findings. Laryngoscopy is required for symptoms persisting > 3 wk. Viral laryngitis is\\nself-limited. Other infectious or irritating causes may require specific treatment.\\nThe most common cause of acute laryngitis is a viral URI. Coughing-induced laryngitis may also occur in\\nbronchitis, pneumonia, influenza, pertussis, measles, and diphtheria.\\n[\\nFig. 54-1.\\n Laryngeal disorders.]\\nExcessive use of the voice (especially with loud speaking or singing), allergic reactions,\\ngastroesophageal reflux, bulimia, or inhalation of irritating substances (eg, cigarette smoke or certain\\naerosolized drugs) can cause acute or chronic laryngitis. Bacterial laryngitis is extremely rare. Smoking\\ncan cause Reinke's edema, which is a watery swelling of both vocal cords.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAn unnatural change of voice is usually the most prominent symptom.

External laryngoceles extend through the thyrohyoid membrane, causing a mass in the neck.\\nLaryngoceles tend to occur in musicians who play wind instruments. Laryngoceles are filled with air and\\ncan be expanded by the Valsalva maneuver. They appear on CT as smooth, ovoid, low-density masses.\\nLaryngoceles may become infected (laryngopyocele) or filled with mucoid fluid. Treatment is excision.\\nSpasmodic Dysphonia\\nSpasmodic dysphonia (vocal cord spasms) is intermittent spasm of laryngeal muscles that\\ncauses an abnormal voice.\\nCause is unknown. Patients often describe the onset of symptoms following a URI, a period of excessive\\nvoice use, or occupational or emotional stress. As a localized form of movement disorder, spasmodic\\ndysphonia has an onset between ages 30 and 50 yr, and about 60% of patients are women.\\nIn the adductor type of spasmodic dysphonia, patients attempt to speak through the spasmodic closure\\nwith a voice that sounds squeezed, effortful, or strained. These spasmodic episodes usually occur when\\nvowel sounds are being formed, particularly at the beginning of words. The less common abductor form\\nresults in sudden interruptions of sound caused by momentary abduction of the vocal cords accompanied\\nby audible escape of air during connected speech.\\nSurgery has been more successful than other approaches for adductor spasmodic dysphonia. The use of\\nbotulinum toxin injection has restored a normal voice in 70% of patients for up to 3 mo. Because the effect\\nis temporary, injections may be repeated. There is no known temporary alleviation of the abductor form of\\nthis disorder.\\nVocal Cord Paralysis\\nVocal cord paralysis has numerous causes and can affect speaking, breathing, and swallowing.\\nThe left vocal cord is affected twice as often as the right, and females are affected more often\\nthan males (3:2). Diagnosis is based on direct visualization. An extensive assessment may be\\nnecessary to determine the cause.

Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is caused by neck or thoracic\\nlesions (eg, aortic aneurysm; mitral stenosis; mediastinal tuberculous adenitis; tumors of the thyroid\\ngland, esophagus, lung, or mediastinal structures), trauma, thyroidectomy, neurotoxins (eg, lead, arsenic,\\nmercury), neurotoxic infections (eg, diphtheria), cervical spine injury or surgery, Lyme disease, and viral\\nillness. Viral neuronitis probably accounts for most idiopathic cases.\\nBilateral vocal cord paralysis is a life-threatening disorder caused by thyroid and cervical surgery, tracheal\\nintubation, trauma, and neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVocal cord paralysis results in loss of vocal cord abduction and adduction. Paralysis may affect\\nphonation, respiration, and deglutition, and food and fluids may be aspirated into the trachea. The\\nparalyzed cord generally lies 2 to 3 mm lateral to the midline. In recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, the\\ncord may move with phonation but not with inspiration. In unilateral paralysis, the voice may be hoarse\\nand breathy, but the airway is usually not obstructed because the normal cord abducts sufficiently. In\\nbilateral paralysis, both cords generally lie within 2 to 3 mm of the midline, and the voice is of good quality\\nbut of limited intensity. The airway, however, is inadequate, resulting in stridor and dyspnea with moderate\\nexertion as each cord is drawn to the midline glottis by an inspiratory Bernoulli effect. Aspiration is also a\\ndanger.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Laryngoscopy\\n• Various tests for possible causes\\nDiagnosis is based on laryngoscopy. The cause must always be sought. Evaluation is guided by\\nabnormalities identified on history and physical examination. During the history, the physician asks about\\nall possible causes of peripheral neuropathy, including chronic heavy metal exposure (arsenic, lead,\\nmercury), drug effects from phenytoin and vincristine, and history of connective tissue disorders, Lyme\\ndisease, sarcoidosis, diabetes, and alcoholism. Further evaluation may include enhanced CT or MRI of\\nthe head, neck, and chest; thyroid scan; barium swallow or bronchoscopy; and esophagoscopy.\\nCricoarytenoid arthritis, which may cause fixation of the cricoarytenoid joint, must be differentiated from a\\nneuromuscular etiology. Fixation is best documented by absence of passive mobility during rigid\\nlaryngoscopy under general anesthesia. Cricoarytenoid arthritis may complicate such conditions as RA,\\nexternal blunt trauma, and prolonged endotracheal intubation.\\nTreatment\\n• For unilateral paralysis, surgical procedures to move cords closer together\\n• For bilateral paralysis, surgical procedures and measures to maintain airway\\nIn unilateral paralysis, treatment is directed at improving voice quality through augmentation,\\nmedialization, or reinnervation.\\nAugmentation involves injecting a paste of plasticized particles, collagen, micronized dermis, or\\nautologous fat into the paralyzed cord, bringing the cords closer together to improve the voice and\\nprevent aspiration.\\nMedialization is shifting the vocal cord toward the midline by inserting an adjustable spacer laterally to the\\naffected cord. This can be done with a local anesthetic, allowing the position of the spacer to be \"tuned\"\\nto the patient\\'s voice. Unlike augmentation with plasticized particles, which permanently fixes the cord, the\\nspacer is both adjustable and removable.\\nReinnervation has only rarely been successful.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 54.

Tumors of the Head and Neck\\nIntroduction\\nThe most common noncutaneous tumor of the head and neck is squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx,\\nfollowed by squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, palatine tonsil, and floor of the mouth. Less\\ncommon are tumors of the salivary glands, jaw, nose and paranasal sinuses, and ear. Tumors of the\\nthyroid gland, eye, and skin are discussed elsewhere in THE MANUAL.\\nExcluding the skin and thyroid gland, > 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell (epidermoid)\\ncarcinomas, and 5% are melanomas, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Patients with sarcomas or carcinomas\\nof the salivary glands or paranasal sinuses are often younger than patients with squamous cell\\ncarcinoma, who are more commonly in their mid-50s and older.\\nEtiology\\nThe vast majority of patients, 85% or more, with cancer of the head and neck have a history of alcohol\\nuse, smoking, or both. Other suspected causes include use of snuff or chewing tobacco, sunlight\\nexposure, previous x-rays of the head and neck, certain viral infections, ill-fitting dental appliances,\\nchronic candidiasis, and poor oral hygiene. In India, oral cancer is extremely common, probably because\\nof chewing betel quid (a mixture of substances, also called paan). Long-term exposure to sunlight and the\\nuse of tobacco products are the primary causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip.\\nPatients who in the past were treated with radiation for acne, excess facial hair, enlarged thymus, or\\nhypertrophic tonsils and adenoids are predisposed to thyroid and salivary gland cancers and benign\\nsalivary tumors.\\nEpstein-Barr virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal cancer, and serum measures of\\ncertain Epstein-Barr virus proteins may be biomarkers of recurrence. Human papillomavirus seems to be\\nassociated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, particularly oropharyngeal cancer. The\\nmechanism for viral-mediated tumor genesis may be distinct from tobacco-related pathways and seem to\\nhave a different, better, prognosis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMost head and neck cancers first manifest as an asymptomatic neck mass, painful mucosal ulceration, or\\nvisible mucosal lesion (eg, leukoplakia, erythroplakia). Subsequent symptoms depend on location and\\nextent of the tumor and include pain, paresthesia, nerve palsies, trismus, and halitosis.

Local tissue invasion eventually is\\nfollowed by metastasis to regional lymph nodes, related in large part to tumor size and extent, and\\nreduces overall survival by nearly half. Distant metastases tend to occur late, usually in patients with\\nadvanced tumor and nodal stages. Metastases occur more commonly among immunocompromised\\npatients. Common sites of distant metastases are the lungs, liver, bone, and brain.\\nHead and neck cancers are staged (see\\nTable 55-1\\n) according to size and site of the primary tumor (T), number and size of metastases to the\\ncervical lymph nodes (N), and evidence of distant metastases (M). Staging usually requires imaging with\\nCT, MRI, or both, and often PET.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is favorable if diagnosis is early and treatment is timely and appropriate. In general, the more\\npoorly differentiated the cancer, the greater the chance of regional and distant metastases. The presence\\nof regional nodal spread reduces overall survival by nearly half. Distant metastasis greatly reduces\\nsurvival, having only rare cures. Local invasion, a criterion for advanced T stage, with invasion of muscle,\\nbone, or cartilage, also significantly decreases cure rate. Perineural spread, as evidenced by pain,\\nparalysis, or numbness, indicates a highly aggressive tumor, is associated with nodal metastasis, and has\\na less favorable prognosis than a similar lesion without perineural invasion.\\nWith appropriate treatment, 5-yr survival can be as high as 90% for stage I, 75 to 80% for stage II, 45 to\\n75% for stage III, and up to 40% for stage IV.

Stage I laryngeal cancers have an excellent survival rate when compared to other sites.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgery, radiation therapy, or both\\n• Sometimes chemotherapy\\nMany stage I tumors, regardless of location, respond similarly to surgery and to radiation therapy, allowing\\nother factors (eg, patient preference) to determine choice of therapy. Thus, the treating physician should\\ncarefully review risks and benefits with the patient. However, at certain locations, there is clear superiority\\nof one modality over another. For\\n[\\nTable 55-1.\\n Staging of Head and Neck Cancer]\\nexample, surgery is the better treatment for early-stage disease involving the oral cavity. In select head\\nand neck cancers, endoscopic surgery has cure rates similar to those of open surgery or radiation, and\\nmorbidity is significantly less. However, many physicians still recommend radiation for early-stage\\nlaryngeal cancer.\\nIf radiation therapy is chosen for primary therapy, it is delivered to the primary site and sometimes\\nbilaterally to the cervical lymph nodes. The treatment of lymphatics, whether by radiation or surgery, is\\ndetermined by the primary site, histologic criteria, and risk of nodal disease.\\nAdvanced-stage disease (stages III and IV) often requires multimodality treatment, incorporating some\\ncombination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Bone or cartilage invasion requires surgical\\nresection of the primary site and usually regional lymph nodes because of the high risk of nodal spread. If\\nthe primary site is treated surgically, then postoperative radiation to the cervical lymph nodes is delivered\\nif there are high-risk features, such as multiple lymph nodes with cancer or extracapsular extension.\\nPostoperative radiation usually is preferred over preoperative radiation, because radiated tissues heal\\npoorly.

Patients with recurrence after\\nradiation therapy should not receive additional radiation and are best treated with surgery.\\nSymptom control:\\n Pain is a common symptom in patients with head and neck cancer and must be\\nadequately addressed. Palliative surgery or radiation may temporarily alleviate pain, and in 30 to 50% of\\npatients, chemotherapy can produce improvement that lasts a mean of 3 mo. A stepwise approach to pain\\nmanagement, as recommended by the WHO, is critical to controlling pain. Severe pain is best managed in\\nassociation with a pain and palliative care specialist.\\nPain, difficulty eating, choking on secretions, and other problems make adequate symptomatic treatment\\nessential. Patient directives regarding such care should be clarified early (see p. \\n3471\\n).\\nAdverse effects of treatment:\\n All cancer treatments have potential complications and expected\\nsequelae. Because many treatments have similar cure rates, the choice of modality is based largely on\\nreal, or perceived, differences in sequelae.\\nAlthough it is commonly thought that surgery requires rehabilitation for swallowing and speaking, many\\nprocedures do not require such rehabilitation. Increasingly complex reconstructive procedures and\\ntechniques, including prostheses, grafts, regional pedicle flaps, and complex free flaps, can restore\\nfunction and appearance often to near normal.\\nToxic effects of chemotherapy include malaise, severe nausea and vomiting, mucositis, transient hair\\nloss, gastroenteritis, hematopoietic and immune suppression, and infection.\\nTherapeutic radiation for head and neck cancers has several adverse effects. The function of any\\nsalivary gland within the beam is permanently destroyed by a dose of about 40 Gy, resulting in\\nxerostomia, which markedly increases the risk of dental caries. Newer radiation techniques, such as\\nintensity-modulated radiation therapy, can minimize or eliminate toxic doses to the parotid glands in\\ncertain patients. Radioprotectant drugs (eg, amifostine) also can help protect salivary function. In addition,\\nthe blood supply of bone, particularly in the mandible, is compromised by doses of > 60 Gy, and\\nosteoradionecrosis may occur \\n(see also p. \\n505\\n). In this condition, tooth extraction sites break down,\\nsloughing bone and soft tissue. Therefore, any needed dental treatment, including scaling, fillings, and\\nextractions, should be done before radiation therapy. Any teeth in poor condition that cannot be\\nrehabilitated should be extracted. Radiation therapy may also cause oral mucositis and dermatitis in the\\noverlying skin, which may result in dermal fibrosis. Loss of taste (ageusia) and impaired smell (dysosmia)\\noften occur but are usually transient.\\nPrevention\\nRemoving risk factors is critical, and all patients should cease tobacco use and limit alcohol consumption.\\nRemoving risk factors also helps prevent disease recurrence in those treated for cancer.

Symptoms are\\nswelling, pain, tenderness, and unexplained tooth mobility; some tumors are discovered on\\nroutine dental x-rays, whereas others are found on routine examinations of the oral cavity and\\nteeth. Treatment depends on location and tumor type. Benign tumors may be observed and\\nmay not need surgical excision, although most tumors require resection with possible\\nreconstruction.\\nIf not initially detected on x-ray, jaw tumors are diagnosed clinically because their growth causes swelling\\nof the face, palate, or alveolar ridge (the part of the jaw supporting the teeth). They can also cause bone\\ntenderness and severe pain.\\nBony outgrowths (torus palatinus, torus mandibularis) may develop on the palate or mandible. These are\\ncommon growths and may prompt concerns about cancer, although they are benign and of concern only\\nif they interfere with dental care or function of the submandibular gland. When on the palate, they are in\\nthe midline and have intact, smooth mucosa. Multiple osteomas seen on dental x-ray may suggest\\nGardner's syndrome.\\nThe most common tumor of the mandible and maxilla is squamous cell carcinoma invading the bone\\nthrough dental sockets. These can involve any portion of the intraoral mandible or maxilla.\\nAmeloblastoma, the most common epithelial odontogenic tumor, usually arises in the posterior mandible. It\\nis slowly invasive and rarely metastatic. On x-ray, it typically appears as multiloculated or soap-bubble\\nradiolucency. Treatment is wide surgical excision and reconstruction if appropriate.\\nOdontoma, the most common odontogenic tumor, affects the dental follicle or the dental tissues and\\nusually appears in the mandibles of young people. Odontomas include fibrous odontomas and\\ncementomas. A clinically absent molar tooth suggests a composite odontoma. Typically, no treatment is\\nindicated. These tumors may be excised when the diagnosis is in doubt.\\nOsteosarcoma, giant cell tumor, Ewing's tumor, multiple myeloma, and metastatic tumors may affect the\\njaw. Treatment is the same as for those tumors in other bony sites.\\nLaryngeal Cancer\\nNinety percent of laryngeal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Smoking, alcohol abuse, lower\\nsocioeconomic status, and being male and > 60 yr increase risk. Early diagnosis is common\\nwith vocal cord tumors because vocal, swallowing, or respiratory symptoms develop early.\\nHowever, supraglottic tumors (above the vocal cords) and subglottic tumors (below the vocal\\ncords) are often very large and at an advanced stage when diagnosed because they are\\nasymptomatic until obstructive symptoms develop. Diagnosis is based on laryngoscopy and\\nbiopsy. Treatment of early-stage tumors is with surgery or radiation. Advanced-stage tumors are\\nmost often treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Children with abnormal facies (who also may have\\ndental malformations requiring correction) should be evaluated by a dentist. In FUO or a systemic\\ninfection of unknown cause, a dental disorder should be considered. A dental consultation is necessary\\nbefore head and neck radiation therapy and is advisable before chemotherapy.\\nClues suggesting systemic disease may be found in the mouth and adjacent structures (see\\nTable 56-1\\n). A dentist should consult a physician when a systemic disorder is suspected, when the patient\\nis taking certain drugs (eg, warfarin, bisphosphonates), and when a patient's ability to withstand general\\nanesthesia or extensive oral surgery must be evaluated. Patients with certain heart valve abnormalities\\nmay require antibiotic prophylaxis to help prevent bacterial endocarditis before undergoing certain dental\\nprocedures (see\\nTables 215-3\\n and\\n215-4\\n on pp. \\n2199\\n and \\n2200\\n).\\nCommon dental disorders are discussed in \\nCh. 57\\n. Dental emergencies, including toothache, are\\ndiscussed in \\nCh. 58\\n.\\nAnatomy and Development\\nTeeth:\\n The teeth are categorized as incisors, canines, premolars, and molars and conventionally are\\nnumbered beginning with the maxillary right 3rd molar (see\\nFig. 56-1\\n).\\nEach tooth has a crown and a root. The canines have the largest and strongest roots. An inner pulp\\ncontains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, surrounded by the hard but porous dentin, a very hard\\nenamel coating that covers the crown. The bonelike cementum is over the root, which, when healthy, is\\ncovered by gingiva (see\\nFig. 56-2\\n). Twenty deciduous\\n[\\nTable 56-1.\\n Oral Findings in Systemic Disorders]\\nteeth normally begin appearing at close to age 6 mo and should all be in place by age 30 mo (see\\nTable 271-1\\n on p. \\n2757\\n). These teeth are followed by 32 permanent teeth that begin to appear by about\\nage 6. The period from age 6 to 11 is called the mixed dentition stage, in which both deciduous and\\npermanent teeth are present. Timing of tooth eruption is one indicator of skeletal age and may identify\\ngrowth retardation or establish age for forensic purposes.\\nSupporting tissues:\\n The gingiva surrounds the teeth at the base of their crown. The alveolar ridges are\\ntrabecular bone containing sockets for the teeth. The periodontium consists of the tissues that support\\nthe teeth—the gingiva, epithelial attachment, connective tissue attachment, periodontal ligament, and\\nalveolar bone. The mandible and maxilla support the alveolar ridges and house the teeth. Saliva from the\\nsalivary glands bathes and protects the teeth. The tongue directs food between the grinding surfaces and\\nhelps clean the teeth. The maxilla receives innervation from the maxillary nerve, the 2nd division of the\\ntrigeminal nerve (the 5th cranial nerve). The mandibular nerve, which is the 3rd and most inferior division\\nof the trigeminal nerve, innervates the mandible.\\nIn the elderly, or in some periodontal diseases, gingival recession exposes the dental root adjacent to the\\ncrown, making root caries common. If tooth destruction results and the tooth must be removed, the\\nmechanical stimulation necessary for maintaining bone integrity ceases. Consequently, atrophy of the\\nalveolar ridge (senile atrophy) begins when teeth are absent.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 56.

Nonkeratinized mucosa occurs over alveolar bone further from the teeth, inside\\nthe lips and cheeks, on the sides and undersurface of the tongue, on the soft palate, and covering the\\nfloor of the mouth. The skin and mucosa of the lips are demarcated by the vermilion border.\\nThe buccal mucosa, including the vestibule and nonkeratinized alveolar mucosa, is usually smooth, moist,\\nand more red than pink (as compared to healthy gingiva). Innocuous entities in this region include linea\\nalba (a thin white line, typically bilateral, on the level of the occlusal plane, where the cheek is bitten),\\nFordyce's granules (aberrant sebaceous glands appearing as < 1 mm light yellow spots that also may\\noccur on the lips), and white sponge nevus (bilateral thick white folds over most of the buccal mucosa).\\nRecognizing these avoids needless biopsy and apprehension. The orifices of the parotid (Stensen's)\\nducts are opposite the maxillary 1st molar on the inside of each cheek and should not be mistaken for an\\nabnormality.\\nThe dorsal surface of the tongue is covered with numerous whitish elevations called the filiform papillae.\\nInterspersed among them are isolated reddish prominences called the fungiform papillae, occurring mostly\\non the anterior part of the tongue. The circumvallate papillae, numbering 8 to 12, are considerably larger\\nand lie posteriorly in a V pattern. The circumvallate papillae do not project from the tongue but instead are\\nsurrounded by a trench. The foliate papillae appear as a series of parallel, slitlike folds on the lateral\\nborders of the tongue, near the anterior pillars of the fauces. They vary in length and can easily be\\nconfused with malignant lesions, as may the foramen cecum, median rhomboid glossitis, and, rarely, a\\nlingual thyroid nodule. Lingual tonsils are components of Waldeyer's ring, are at the back of the tongue,\\nand should not be mistaken for lesions. If an apparent abnormality is bilateral, it is almost always a normal\\nvariant.\\nInnervation is supplied by the lingual nerves (branches of the 5th cranial nerves), for general sensory\\ninnervation, and the chorda tympani fibers (of the 7th cranial nerve), which innervate the taste buds of the\\nanterior two thirds of the tongue. Behind the circumvallate papillae, the glossopharyngeal nerves (9th\\ncranial nerves) provide the sensations of touch and taste. The tongue has taste receptors for sweet,\\nsalty, sour, bitter, and umami (a savory\\n[\\nFig. 56-2.\\n Section of a canine tooth.]\\ntaste triggered by natural glutamic acid and glutamates such as the flavoring agent monosodium\\nglutamate). Although previously thought to be isolated to particular portions of the tongue, these receptors\\nare now known to be distributed over the surface of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerves (12th cranial\\nnerves) control movement of the tongue.\\nThe major salivary glands are the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. Most oral\\nmucosal surfaces contain many minor mucus-secreting salivary glands. Anteriorly and near the midline on\\neach side of the floor of the mouth are the openings of Wharton's ducts, which drain the ipsilateral\\nsubmandibular and sublingual glands. The parotid glands drain into the cheeks via Stensen's ducts.\\nEvaluation\\nThe first routine dental examination should take place by age 1 yr or when the first tooth erupts.\\nSubsequent evaluations should take place at 6-mo intervals or whenever symptoms develop.

Percussion sensitivity or pain on biting also can\\nindicate an incomplete (green stick) fracture of a tooth. Percussion tenderness in multiple adjacent\\nmaxillary teeth may result from maxillary sinusitis. Tenderness to palpation around the apices of the teeth\\nalso may indicate an abscess.\\nLoose teeth usually indicate severe periodontal disease but can be caused by bruxism (clenching or\\ngrinding of teeth—see p. \\n506\\n) or trauma that damages periodontal tissues.

After a tooth is cleaned, a mucopolysaccharide coating (pellicle)\\nis deposited almost immediately. After about 24 h, bacterial colonization turns the pellicle into plaque.

In\\nectodermal dysplasia, teeth are absent or conical, so that dentures are needed from childhood.\\nDentinogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal dominant disorder, causes abnormal dentin that is dull bluish\\nbrown and opalescent and does not cushion the overlying enamel adequately. Such teeth cannot\\nwithstand occlusal stresses and rapidly become worn. People with pituitary dwarfism or with congenital\\nhypoparathyroidism have small dental roots; people with gigantism have large ones. Acromegaly causes\\nexcess cementum in the roots as well as enlargement of the jaws, so teeth may become widely spaced.\\nAcromegaly also can cause an open bite to develop in adulthood. Congenitally narrow lateral incisors\\noccur in the absence of systemic disease. The most commonly congenitally absent teeth are the 3rd\\nmolars, followed in frequency by the maxillary lateral incisors and 2nd mandibular premolars.\\nDefects in tooth color must be differentiated from the darkening or yellowing that is caused by food\\npigments, aging, and, most prominently, smoking. A tooth may appear gray because of pulpal necrosis,\\nusually due to extensive caries penetrating the pulp or because of hemosiderin deposited in the dentin\\nafter trauma, with or without pulpal necrosis. Children\\'s teeth darken appreciably and permanently after\\neven short-term use of tetracyclines by the mother during the 2nd half of pregnancy or by the child during\\nodontogenesis (tooth development), specifically calcification of the crowns, which lasts until age 9.\\nTetracyclines rarely cause permanent discoloration of fully formed teeth in adults. However, minocycline\\ndarkens bone, which can be seen in the mouth when the overlying gingiva and mucosa are thin. Affected\\nteeth fluoresce with distinctive colors under ultraviolet light corresponding to the specific tetracycline\\ntaken. In congenital porphyria, both the deciduous and permanent teeth may have red or brownish\\ndiscoloration but always fluoresce red from the pigment deposited in the dentin. Congenital\\nhyperbilirubinemia causes a yellowish tooth discoloration. Teeth can be whitened (see\\nTable 56-4\\n).\\nDefects in tooth enamel may be caused by rickets, which results in a rough, irregular band in the enamel.\\nAny prolonged febrile illness during odontogenesis can cause a permanent narrow zone of chalky, pitted\\nenamel or simply white discoloration visible after the tooth erupts. Thus, the age at which the disease\\noccurred and its duration can be estimated from the location and height of the band. Amelogenesis\\nimperfecta, an autosomal dominant disease, causes severe enamel hypoplasia. Chronic vomiting and\\nesophageal reflux can decalcify the dental crowns, primarily the lingual surfaces of the maxillary anterior\\nteeth. Chronic snorting of cocaine can result in widespread decalcification of teeth, because the drug\\ndissociates in saliva into a base and HCl. Chronic use of methamphetamines markedly increases dental\\ncaries (\"meth mouth\").\\nSwimmers who spend a lot of time in over-chlorinated pools may lose enamel from the outer facial/buccal\\nside of the teeth, especially the maxillary incisors, canines, and 1st premolars. If Na carbonate has been\\nadded to the pool water to correct pH, then brown calculus develops but can be removed by a dental\\ncleaning.\\nFluorosis is mottled enamel that may develop in children who drink water containing > 1 ppm of fluoride\\nduring tooth development. Fluorosis depends on the amount of fluoride ingested. Enamel changes range\\nfrom irregular whitish opaque areas to severe brown discoloration of the entire crown with a roughened\\nsurface. Such teeth are highly resistant to dental caries.\\nThe lips are palpated. With the patient\\'s mouth open, the buccal mucosa and vestibules are examined\\nwith a tongue blade; then the hard and soft palates, uvula, and oropharynx are viewed. The patient is\\nasked to extend the tongue as far as possible, exposing the dorsum, and to move the extended tongue as\\nfar as possible to each side, so that its posterolateral surfaces can be seen. If a patient does not extend\\nthe tongue far enough to expose the circumvallate papillae, the examiner grasps the tip of the tongue with\\na gauze pad and extends it.

To make palpation more comfortable, the examiner asks the patient\\nto relax the mouth, keeping it open just wide enough to allow access.\\nThe temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is assessed by looking for jaw deviation on opening and by palpating\\nthe head of the condyle anterior to the external auditory meatus. Examiners then place their little fingers\\ninto the external ear canals with the pads of the fingertips lightly pushing anteriorly while patients open\\nwidely and close 3 times. Patients also should be able to comfortably open wide enough to fit 3 of their\\nfingers vertically between the incisors (typically 4 to 5 cm).

Modern techniques reduce radiation exposure to a\\nnear-negligible level. Patients at high risk of caries (ie, those who have had caries detected during the\\nclinical examination, have many restorations, or have recurrent caries on teeth previously restored)\\nshould undergo bite-wing x-rays every 12 mo. Otherwise, bite-wings are indicated every 2 to 3 yr. A\\npanoramic x-ray can yield useful information about tooth development, cysts or tumors of the jaws,\\nsupernumerary or congenitally absent teeth, 3rd molar impaction, Eagle's syndrome (less frequently), and\\ncarotid plaques.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nWith aging, resting salivary secretion diminishes and can be further diminished by drugs, although meal-\\nstimulated salivary flow is usually adequate. The flattened cusps of worn teeth and weakness of the\\nmasticatory muscles may make chewing tiresome, impairing food intake. Loss of bone mass in the jaws\\n(particularly the alveolar portion), dryness of \\nthe mouth, thinning of the oral mucosa, and impaired\\ncoordination of lip, cheek, and tongue movements may make denture retention difficult. The taste buds\\nbecome less sensitive, so the elderly may add abundant seasonings, particularly salt (which is harmful for\\nsome), or they may desire very hot foods for more taste, sometimes burning the often atrophic oral\\nmucosa. Gingival recession and xerostomia contribute to development of root caries. Despite these\\nchanges, improved dental hygiene has greatly decreased the prevalence of tooth loss, and most older\\npeople can expect to retain their teeth.\\nPoor oral health contributes to poor nutritional intake, which impairs general health. Dental disease\\n(particularly periodontitis) is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of coronary artery disease.\\nEdentulous patients cannot have periodontitis (because they do not have a periodontium), although\\nperiodontitis may have resulted in their tooth loss.

Bruxism can abrade and eventually wear down dental crowns\\nand loosen teeth. In many people, headaches, jaw pain, or both actually are the result of bruxism. The\\nmost severe and extensive grinding and clenching occurs during sleep, so the person may be oblivious to\\nit, but family members might notice.\\nTreatment requires that the patient consciously try to reduce bruxism while awake. Plastic oral appliances\\n(night guards) that prevent occlusal contact by fitting between the teeth can be used while sleeping.\\nWhen symptoms are severe, a guard can be used also during the day. Usually, such devices are made by\\ndentists. However, if the only problem is tooth wear, OTC heat-moldable devices, fitted at home, are\\navailable. Mild anxiolytics, particularly benzodiazepines, may help until a night guard is available but\\nshould not be used for extended periods.\\nHalitosis\\n(Fetor Oris; Oral Malodor)\\nHalitosis is a frequent or persistent unpleasant odor to the breath.\\nPathophysiology\\nHalitosis most often results from fermentation of food particles by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in the\\nmouth, producing volatile sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. Causative\\nbacteria may be present in areas of gingival or periodontal disease, particularly when ulceration or\\nnecrosis is present. The causative organisms reside deep in periodontal pockets around teeth. In patients\\nwith healthy periodontal tissue, these bacteria may deposit on the dorsal posterior tongue.\\nFactors contributing to the overgrowth of causative bacteria include decreased salivary flow (eg, due to\\nparotid disease, Sjogren's syndrome, use of anticholinergics—see p. \\n513\\n), salivary stagnation, and\\nincreased salivary pH.\\nCertain foods or spices, after digestion, release the odor of that substance to the lungs; the exhaled odor\\nmay be unpleasant to others. For example, the odor of garlic is noted on the breath by others 2 or 3 h\\nafter consumption, long after it is gone from the mouth.\\nEtiology\\nAbout 85% of cases result from oral conditions. A variety of systemic and extraoral conditions account for\\nthe remainder (see\\nTable 56-5\\n).\\nThe \\nmost common causes\\n overall are the following:\\n• Gingival or periodontal disease\\n• Smoking\\n• Ingested foods that have a volatile component\\nGI disorders rarely cause halitosis because the esophagus is normally collapsed. It is a fallacy that breath\\nodor reflects the state of digestion and bowel function.\\nOther breath odors:\\n Several systemic diseases produce volatile substances detectable on the breath,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 56.

In general, oral causes result in a putrefying, pungent\\nsmell, whereas systemic conditions result in a more subtle, abnormal odor. Ideally, for 48 h before the\\nexamination, the patient avoids eating garlic or onions, and for 2 h before, the patient abstains from\\neating, \\nchewing, drinking, gargling, rinsing, or smoking. During the test, the patient exhales 10 cm away\\nfrom the examiner's nose, first through the mouth and then with the mouth closed. A worse odor through\\nthe mouth suggests an oral etiology. A worse odor through the nose suggests a nasal or sinus etiology.\\nSimilar odor through both nose and mouth suggests a systemic or pulmonary cause. If site of origin is\\nunclear, the posterior tongue is scraped with a plastic spoon. After 5 sec, the spoon is sniffed 5 cm from\\nthe examiner's nose.\\nRed flags:\\n The following findings are of particular concern:\\n• Fever\\n• Purulent nasal discharge or sputum\\n• Visible or palpable oral lesions\\nInterpretation of findings:\\n Because oral causes are by far the most common, any visible oral disease\\nmay be presumed to be the cause in patients with no extraoral symptoms or signs.

Home treatment involves enhanced oral hygiene, including thorough flossing,\\ntoothbrushing, and brushing of the tongue with the toothbrush or a scraper. Mouthwashes are of limited\\nbenefit except to mask odor for about 20 min. Psychogenic halitosis may require psychiatric consultation.\\nGeriatrics Essentials\\nElderly patients are more likely to take drugs that cause dry mouth, which leads to difficulties with oral\\nhygiene and hence to halitosis, but are otherwise not more likely to have halitosis. Also, oral cancers are\\nmore common with aging and are more of a concern among elderly than younger patients.\\nKey Points\\n• Most halitosis comes from fermentation of food particles by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in the\\nmouth.\\n• Extraoral disorders may cause halitosis but are often accompanied by suggestive findings.\\n• It is a fallacy that breath odor reflects the state of digestion and bowel function.\\n• Mouthwashes provide only brief benefit.\\nMalocclusion\\nMalocclusion is abnormal contact between the maxillary and mandibular teeth.\\nNormally, each dental arch consists of teeth in side-by-side contact, forming a smooth curve, with the\\nmaxillary anterior teeth overlying the upper third of the mandibular anterior teeth. The buccal (outer)\\ncusps of the maxillary posterior teeth are external to the corresponding cusps of the mandibular posterior\\nteeth. On each side of the mouth, the anterior buccal cusp of the maxillary 1st permanent molar fits into\\nthe anterior buccal groove of the mandibular 1st molar. Because the outer parts of all maxillary teeth are\\nnormally external to the mandibular teeth, the lips and cheeks are displaced from between the teeth so\\nthat they are not bitten. The lingual (inner) surfaces of the lower teeth form a smaller arc than those of the\\nupper teeth, confining the tongue and minimizing the likelihood of its being bitten. All the maxillary teeth\\nshould contact the corresponding mandibular teeth, so that the masticatory forces (which may be > 150 lb\\nin the molar region and 250 lb when clenching during sleep) are widely distributed. If these forces are\\napplied to only a few teeth, those teeth will eventually loosen.\\nEtiology\\nMalocclusion often results from jaw and tooth size discrepancies (ie, the jaw is too small or the teeth are\\ntoo large for the jaw to accommodate them in proper alignment) but may be caused by a number of\\ncongenital deformities and disorders or by tooth loss. When permanent teeth are lost, adjacent teeth shift\\nand opposing teeth extrude, causing malocclusion unless a bridge, implant, or partial denture is worn to\\nprevent these movements. When children lose deciduous teeth prematurely, the teeth more posterior in\\nthe arch or the permanent 1st molars often drift forward, leaving insufficient space for other permanent\\nteeth to erupt. Malocclusion after \\nfacial trauma may indicate tooth displacement or jaw fracture. In\\nectodermal dysplasia, malocclusion results from having too few teeth.\\nEvaluation\\nOcclusion is checked on both sides of the mouth by retracting each cheek with a tongue depressor while\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 56.

Malocclusion sometimes is identified as early as the first\\ndental visit. Early identification may make later treatment easier and more effective.\\nTreatment\\nMalocclusions are corrected primarily for aesthetic and psychologic reasons. However, in some cases,\\ntreatment may increase resistance to caries (in specific teeth), to anterior tooth fracture, and, possibly, to\\nperiodontal disease or stripping of the gingiva on the palate. Treatment may improve speech and\\nmastication as well. Occlusion can be improved by aligning teeth properly, by selectively grinding teeth\\nand restorations that contact prematurely, and by inserting crowns or onlays to build up tooth surfaces\\nthat are below the plane of occlusion.\\nOrthodontic appliances (braces) apply a continuous mild force to teeth to gradually remodel the\\nsurrounding alveolar bone. Extraction of one or more permanent teeth (usually a 1st premolar) may be\\nneeded to allow other teeth to be repositioned or to erupt into a stable alignment.

Patients using these corticosteroids should be monitored for\\ncandidiasis. If topical corticosteroids are ineffective, prednisone (eg, 40 mg po once/day) may be needed\\nfor ≤ 5 days. Continuous or particularly severe RAS is best treated by a specialist in oral medicine.\\nTreatment may require prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids, azathioprine or other\\nimmunosuppressants, pentoxifylline, or thalidomide. Intralesional injections can be done with\\nbetamethasone, dexamethasone, or triamcinolone. Supplemental B\\n1\\n, B\\n2\\n, B\\n6\\n, B\\n12\\n, folate, or iron lessens\\nRAS in some patients.\\nXerostomia\\nXerostomia is dry mouth caused by reduced or absent flow of saliva. This condition can result in\\ndiscomfort, interfere with speech and swallowing, make wearing dentures difficult, cause halitosis, and\\nimpair oral hygiene by causing a decrease in oral pH and an increase in bacterial growth. Longstanding\\nxerostomia can result in severe tooth decay and oral candidiasis. Xerostomia is a common complaint\\namong older adults, affecting about 20% of the elderly.\\nPathophysiology\\nStimulation of the oral mucosa signals the salivatory nuclei in the medulla, triggering an efferent\\nresponse. The efferent nerve impulses release acetylcholine at salivary gland nerve terminals, activating\\nmuscarinic receptors (M\\n3\\n), which increase saliva production and flow. Medullary signals responsible for\\nsalivation may also be modulated by cortical inputs from other stimuli (eg, taste, smell, anxiety).\\nEtiology\\nXerostomia is usually caused by the following:\\n• Drugs\\n• Radiation to the head and neck (for cancer treatment)\\nSystemic disorders are less commonly the cause, but xerostomia is common in Sjogren's syndrome and\\nmay occur in HIV/AIDS, uncontrolled diabetes, and certain other disorders.\\nDrugs:\\n Drugs are the most common cause (see\\nTable 56-7\\n); about 400 prescription drugs\\n[\\nTable 56-7.\\n Some Causes of Xerostomia]\\nand many OTC drugs cause decreased salivation. The most common include the following:\\n• Anticholinergics\\n• Antiparkinsonians\\n• Antineoplastics (chemotherapy)\\nChemotherapy drugs cause severe dryness and stomatitis while they are being taken; these problems\\nusually end after therapy is stopped.\\nOther common drug classes that cause xerostomia include antihypertensives, anxiolytics, and\\nantidepressants (less severe with SSRIs than with tricyclics).\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 56.

Common Dental Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nCommon dental disorders include caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, and pulpitis. Dental emergencies, such\\nas toothache, fractured or avulsed teeth, and postextraction complications, are discussed in \\nCh. 58\\n.\\nCaries\\nCaries is tooth decay, commonly called cavities. The symptoms—tender, painful teeth—appear\\nlate. Diagnosis is based on inspection, probing of the enamel surface with a fine metal\\ninstrument, and dental x-rays. Treatment involves removing affected tooth structure and\\nrestoring it with various materials. Fluoride, diligent dental hygiene, sealants, and proper diet\\ncan prevent virtually all caries.\\nEtiology\\nCaries is caused by acids produced by bacteria in dental plaque. Plaque is, at first, a soft, thin film of\\nbacteria, mucin, dead epithelial cells, and food debris that develops on the tooth surface within about 24 h\\nafter the tooth is cleaned. \\nMutans streptococci\\n is a group of related bacteria that grow in plaque and can\\ncause caries. Some strains are more cariogenic than others. Eventually (commonly, after 72 h), soft\\nplaque mineralizes, mainly with Ca, phosphate, and other minerals, becoming calculus (hard plaque or\\ntartar), which cannot easily be removed with a toothbrush.\\nRisk factors:\\n There are several risk factors for caries:\\n• Dental defects\\n• High-acid or low-fluoride environment\\n• Reduced salivary flow\\nMany teeth have open enamel pits, fissures, and grooves, which may extend from the surface to the\\ndentin. These defects may be wide enough to harbor bacteria but too narrow to clean effectively. They\\npredispose teeth to caries. Large amounts of sugar in the diet provide nutrients for plaque-forming\\nbacteria.\\nA tooth surface is more susceptible to caries when it is poorly calcified, has low fluoride exposure, or is in\\nan acidic environment. Typically, decalcification begins when the pH at the tooth falls below 5.5 (eg, when\\nlactic acid-producing bacteria colonize the area or when people drink cola beverages, which contain\\nphosphoric acid).\\nRampant caries in deciduous teeth suggests prolonged contact with infant formula, milk, or juice, typically\\nwhen an infant goes to bed with a bottle (baby or nursing bottle caries). Thus, bedtime bottles should\\ncontain only water.\\nThe elderly often take drugs that reduce salivary flow, predisposing to caries. The elderly also have a\\nhigher incidence of root caries because of gingival recession, exposure of root surfaces, and declining\\nmanual dexterity.\\nComplications:\\n Untreated caries leads to tooth destruction, infections, and the need for extractions and\\nreplacement prostheses. Premature loss of deciduous teeth may shift the adjacent teeth, hindering\\neruption of their permanent successors.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCaries initially involves only the enamel and causes no symptoms. A cavity that invades the dentin causes\\npain, first when hot, cold, or \\nsweet foods or beverages contact the involved tooth, and later with chewing\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 57.

Pain can be intense and persistent when the pulp is severely involved (see \\nPulpitis\\n on p.\\n522\\n).\\nDiagnosis\\n• Direct inspection\\n• Sometimes use of x-rays or special testing instruments\\nRoutine, frequent (q 6 to 12 mo) clinical evaluation identifies early caries at a time when minimal\\nintervention prevents its progression. A thin probe, sometimes special dyes, and transillumination by\\nfiberoptic lights are used, frequently supplemented by new devices that detect caries by changes in\\nelectrical conductivity or laser reflectivity. However, x-rays are still important for detecting caries,\\ndetermining the depth of involvement, and identifying caries under existing restorations.\\nTreatment\\n• Restorative therapy\\n• Sometimes a root canal and crown\\nIncipient caries (which is confined to the enamel) should be remineralized through improved home care\\n(brushing and flossing), cleanings, prescriptions for high-fluoride toothpastes, and multiple fluoride\\napplications at the dental office.\\nThe primary treatment of caries that has entered dentin is removal by drilling, followed by filling of the\\nresultant defect. For very deep cavities, a temporary filling may be left in place 6 to 10 wk in the hope that\\na tooth will deposit reparative dentin, preventing exposure of the pulp, which necessitates root canal\\ntreatment.\\nFillings for occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth, which bear the brunt of mastication, must be composed of\\nstrong materials. The most common material has been silver amalgam, which combines silver, mercury,\\ncopper, tin, and, occasionally, zinc, palladium, or indium. Amalgam is inexpensive and lasts an average of\\n14 yr. However, if oral hygiene is good and if amalgam was placed using a rubber dam for isolation from\\nsaliva, many amalgam fillings last > 40 yr. Although concern has been raised about mercury poisoning,\\nthe number of amalgam fillings a person has bears no relationship to blood mercury levels. Replacing\\namalgam is not recommended because it is expensive, damages tooth structure, and actually increases\\npatient exposure to mercury.\\nComposite resins, which have a more acceptable appearance, have long been used in anterior teeth,\\nwhere aesthetics are primary and the forces of chewing are minimal. Some patients request them in\\nposterior teeth as well, and they are becoming common there. However, composite resins under high\\nocclusal stress generally last less than half as long as amalgam and tend to develop recurrent decay\\nbecause the composite resin shrinks when it hardens and expands and contracts with heat and cold more\\nthan the tooth or other filling materials. The current generation of composites also closely resemble\\nenamel but do not appear to have the same incidence of recurrent caries as earlier materials and may\\nalso last longer. However, although long-term results with these newer amalgam substitutes appear good,\\ndata equivalent in numbers and duration to those with amalgam are not yet available.\\nIf decay leaves too little dentin to hold a restoration, a dentist replaces the missing dentin with cement,\\namalgam, composite, or other materials. Sometimes a post must be inserted into one or more roots to\\nsupport a gold, silver, or composite core, which replaces the coronal dentin. This procedure necessitates\\na root canal filling, in which an opening is made in the tooth and the pulp is removed. The root canal\\nsystem is thoroughly debrided, shaped, and then filled with gutta-percha. The outer tooth surfaces (what\\nwould have been the enamel) are then reduced so that an artificial crown, usually made of gold,\\nporcelain, or both, can be placed. Crowns for anterior teeth consist of, or are covered with, porcelain.\\nPrevention\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 57. Common Dental Disorders\\n620'),\n",

Maintaining good oral hygiene and minimizing\\nsugar intake are especially important.\\nRemoval of plaque at least q 24 h, usually by brushing and flossing, helps prevent dental caries.

Irritation due to plaque deepens the normal crevice between the tooth and\\ngingiva, creating gingival pockets. These pockets contain bacteria that may cause both gingivitis and root\\ncaries. Other local factors, such as malocclusion, dental calculus, food impaction, faulty dental\\nrestorations, and xerostomia, play a secondary role.\\nSystemic causes:\\n Gingivitis also commonly occurs at puberty, during menstruation and pregnancy, and\\nat menopause, presumably because of hormonal changes. Similarly, oral contraceptives may exacerbate\\ninflammation.\\nGingivitis may be an early sign of a systemic disorder, particularly those that affect the response to\\ninfection (eg, diabetes, AIDS, vitamin deficiency, leukopenia), particularly if it occurs in patients with\\nminimal dental plaque. Some patients with Crohn's disease have a cobblestone area of granulomatous\\ngingival hypertrophy when intestinal flare-ups occur. Exposure to heavy metals (eg, lead, bismuth) may\\ncause gingivitis and a dark line at the gingival margin. Severe deficiency of niacin or vitamin C can cause\\ngingivitis.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSimple gingivitis first causes a deepening of the sulcus (gingival crevice) between the tooth \\nand the\\ngingiva, followed by a band of red, inflamed gingiva along one or more teeth, with swelling of the\\ninterdental papillae and easy bleeding. Pain is usually absent. It may resolve, remain superficial for years,\\nor occasionally progress to periodontitis.\\nPericoronitis is acute, painful inflammation of the gingival flap over a partly erupted tooth, usually around\\nmandibular 3rd molars (wisdom teeth). Infection is common, and an abscess may develop. Pericoronitis\\noften recurs as food gets trapped beneath the flap. The gingival flap disappears when the tooth is fully\\nerupted.\\nDesquamative gingivitis may occur during menopause. It is characterized by deep red, painful gingival\\ntissue that bleeds easily. Vesicles may precede desquamation. The gingivae are soft because the\\nkeratinized cells that resist abrasion by food particles are absent. A similar gingival lesion may be\\nassociated with pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, or\\natrophic lichen planus.\\nDuring pregnancy, swelling, especially of the interdental papillae, is likely to occur. Pedunculated gingival\\ngrowths often arise in the interdental papillae during the 1st trimester, may persist throughout pregnancy,\\nand may or may not subside after delivery. Pregnancy tumors are soft reddish masses that are,\\nhistologically, pyogenic granulomas. They develop rapidly and then remain static. An underlying irritant is\\ncommon, such as calculus or a restoration with a rough margin.\\nUncontrolled diabetes can exaggerate the effects of gingival irritants, making secondary infections and\\nacute gingival abscesses common.\\nIn leukemia, the gingivae may become engorged with a leukemic infiltrate, exhibiting clinical symptoms of\\nedema, pain, and easily induced bleeding.\\nIn scurvy (vitamin C deficiency), the gingivae are inflamed, hyperplastic, and engorged, bleeding easily.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 57.

Debridement is done\\nover several days. The patient uses a soft toothbrush to wipe the teeth. Rinses at hourly intervals with\\nwarm normal saline or twice/day with 1.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.12% chlorhexidine may help during\\nthe first few days after initial debridement. Essential supportive measures include improved oral hygiene\\n(done gently at first), adequate nutrition, high fluid intake, rest, analgesics as needed, and avoiding\\nirritation (eg, caused by smoking or hot or spicy foods). Marked improvement usually occurs within 24 to\\n48 h, after which debridement can be completed. If debridement is delayed (eg, if a dentist or the\\ninstruments necessary for debridement are unavailable), oral antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin 500 mg,\\nerythromycin 250 mg, or tetracycline 250 mg q 6 h) provide rapid relief and can be continued until 72 h\\nafter symptoms resolve.

Diagnosis is based on inspection, periodontal probing, and x-rays.\\nTreatment involves dental cleaning that extends under the gums and a vigorous home hygiene\\nprogram. Advanced cases may require antibiotics and surgery.\\nEtiology\\nPeriodontitis usually develops when gingivitis, usually with abundant plaque and calculus beneath the\\ngingival margin, has not been adequately treated. In periodontitis, the deep pockets can harbor anaerobic\\norganisms \\nthat do more damage than those usually present in simple gingivitis. The gingiva progressively\\nloses its attachment to the teeth, periodontal pockets deepen, and bone loss begins. With progressive\\nbone loss, teeth may loosen, and gingiva recedes. Tooth migration is common in later stages.\\nSystemic causes:\\n Systemic diseases that predispose patients to periodontitis include diabetes\\n(especially type 1); acquired, familial, and cyclic neutropenia; leukemia; Down syndrome; leukocyte\\nadhesion deficiency syndromes; Papillon-Lefevre syndrome; Crohn's disease; histiocytosis syndromes;\\nagranulocytosis; lazy leukocyte syndrome; hypogammaglobulinemia; Chediak-Higashi syndrome;\\nglycogen storage disease; infantile genetic agranulocytosis; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (types IV and VIII);\\nvitamin C deficiency (scurvy); and hypophosphatasia. Faulty occlusion, causing an excessive functional\\nload on teeth, may contribute to progression of a particular type of periodontitis characterized by angular\\nbony defects.\\nPathophysiology\\nPeriodontitis is usually chronic and characterized by periods of exacerbation and remission. Chronic\\nperiodontitis (formerly adult periodontitis) occurs in localized and generalized forms, and people with\\nsignificant disease tend to be > 35 yr. About 85% of the population is affected to a mild degree, but the\\nmost advanced cases are seen in less than 5% of the population.\\nAggressive periodontitis:\\n Several more rapidly progressive subtypes of chronic periodontitis exist,\\ncollectively known as aggressive periodontitis. Aggressive periodontitis may develop as early as\\nchildhood, sometimes before age 3 yr. Patients may have severe bone loss, even tooth loss, by age 20.\\nNeutrophil function may be defective in aggressive periodontitis; its clinical significance is unknown.\\nIn one type of aggressive periodontitis that occurs in healthy adolescents (formerly called localized\\njuvenile periodontitis), patients often have significant colonization of \\nActinobacillus\\nactinomycetemcomitans\\n. Typically, the signs of inflammation are minor. The disease is detected by\\nperiodontal probing or x-rays, which show localized, deep (vertical) bone loss, commonly limited to the 1st\\nmolars and incisors. Bone loss progresses faster than in adult periodontitis, often at a rate of 3 to 4\\nμ\\nm/day.\\nAn uncommon type of aggressive periodontitis (formerly called prepubertal periodontitis) affects\\ndeciduous teeth, usually shortly after eruption. Generalized acute proliferative gingivitis and rapid alveolar\\nbone destruction are its hallmarks. Patients also have frequent bouts of otitis media and are usually\\ndiagnosed by age 4 yr. In some patients, the disease resolves before the permanent teeth erupt.\\nTreatment regimens are under study.\\nPrototypical aggressive periodontitis (formerly called rapidly progressive periodontitis) occurs in patients\\naged 20 to 35 yr. It is often associated with \\nA. actinomycetemcomitans\\n, \\nPorphyromonas gingivalis\\n,\\nEikenella corrodens\\n, and many gram-negative bacilli, but cause and effect are not clear. Some cases\\nresult from undiagnosed localized juvenile periodontitis or prepubertal periodontitis, but others appear\\nindependently.\\nHIV-associated periodontitis is a particularly virulent, rapidly progressing disease.

When\\nthe stimulus is removed, the pain ceases within 1 to 2 sec.\\nIn irreversible pulpitis, pain occurs spontaneously or lingers minutes after the stimulus is removed. A\\npatient may have difficulty locating the tooth from which the pain originates, even confusing the maxillary\\nand mandibular arches (but not the left and right sides of the mouth).

Missing teeth may cause cosmetic, phonation, and occlusal problems and may allow movement of\\nremaining teeth.\\nTypes:\\n Dental appliances include fixed bridges, removable partial or complete dentures, and osseo-\\nintegrated implants.\\nA \\nbridge\\n (fixed partial denture) is composed of false teeth cast or soldered to each other and, at each\\nend, to a crown that is cemented to natural (abutment) teeth, which bear all stress of biting. A bridge is\\nnot removed. A bridge is smaller than a removable partial denture, but one or multiple bridges can be\\nmade to replace many of the teeth in a dental arch.\\nA \\nremovable partial denture\\n, typically an appliance with clasps that snap over abutment teeth, may be\\nremoved for cleaning and during sleep. Part of the occlusal stress may be borne by the soft tissues under\\nthe denture, often on both sides of the jaw. This appliance commonly is used when many teeth have to be\\nreplaced and bridges or implants are not feasible or affordable.\\nComplete dentures\\n are removable appliances used when no teeth remain. They help a patient chew\\nand improve speech and appearance but do not provide the efficiency or sensation of natural dentition.\\nWhen teeth are absent, the mandible slowly resorbs, resulting in ill-fitting dentures that require revision\\n(called reline or rebase) or replacement. Alternatives are oral surgical procedures to enlarge the alveolar\\nridge or dental implants to replace missing teeth.\\nAn \\nimplant\\n is typically a titanium cylinder or screw that replaces a tooth root. One or more implants are\\nplaced into the alveolar bone, where they ankylose. After 4 to 6 mo, artificial teeth are attached to the\\nimplants. Implants are not readily removable, although the prostheses they support can be. The potential\\nfor infection at these sites warrants scrupulous attention to oral hygiene.\\nDental appliances and surgery:\\n Generally, all removable dental appliances are removed before general\\nanesthesia, throat surgery, or convulsive therapy to prevent their breakage or aspiration. They are stored\\nin water to prevent changes in shape. However, some anesthesiologists believe that leaving appliances in\\nplace aids the passage of an airway tube, keeps the face in a more normal shape so that the anesthetic\\nmask fits better, prevents natural teeth from injuring the opposing gingiva of a completely edentulous jaw,\\nand does not interfere with laryngoscopy.\\nDenture problems:\\n Occasionally, the mucosa beneath a denture becomes inflamed (denture sore\\nmouth, inflammatory papillary hyperplasia). Contributing factors to this usually painless condition include\\ncandidal infections, poor denture fit, poor hygiene, excessive movement of the denture, and, most\\nfrequently, wearing a denture 24 h/day. The mucosa appears red and velvety. Candidal overgrowth may\\nbe indicated by adherent cottonlike patches or, more commonly, erosive lesions on the mucosa. The\\npresence of \\nCandida\\n can be confirmed by the microscopic appearance of typical branching hyphae.\\nWithout \\nCandida,\\n inflammatory papillary hyperplasia is unlikely.\\nA new well-made denture almost always improves the situation. Other treatments consist of improving\\noral and denture hygiene, refitting the existing denture, removing the denture for extended periods, and\\nusing anti-fungal therapy (nystatin rinses for the mouth and overnight nystatin soaks for the denture).\\nSoaking the denture in a commercial cleanser is sometimes helpful. Other options are applying nystatin\\nsuspension to the tissue surface of the denture and clotrimazole troches 10 mg 5 times/day. Ketoconazole\\n200 mg po once/day may be required.

Dental procedures requiring prophylaxis are those that require manipulation or perforation\\nof gingival or oral mucosa or that involve the root end area of the teeth (ie, those most likely to cause\\nbacteremia). The preferred drug is amoxicillin 2 g po 30 to 60 min before the procedure. For those who\\ncannot tolerate penicillins, alternatives include clindamycin 600 mg or cephalexin 2 g.\\nFractured and Avulsed Teeth\\nTooth fracture:\\n Fractures are divided by depth into those that\\n• Affect only the enamel\\n• Expose the dentin\\n• Expose the pulp\\nIf the fracture involves only the enamel, patients notice rough or sharp edges but are asymptomatic.\\nDental treatment to smooth the edges and improve appearance is elective.\\nIf dentin is exposed but not the dental pulp, patients usually exhibit sensitivity to cold air and water.\\nTreatment is a mild analgesic and referral to a dentist. Dental treatment consists of restoration of the\\ntooth by a composite (white filling) or, if the fracture is extensive, a dental crown, to cover the exposed\\ndentin.\\nIf the pulp is exposed (indicated by bleeding from the tooth) or if the tooth is mobile, dental referral is\\nurgent. Dental treatment usually involves a root canal.\\nRoot fractures and alveolar fractures are not visible, but the tooth (or several teeth) may be mobile.\\nDental referral is also urgent for stabilization by bonding an orthodontic arch wire or polyethylene line\\nonto several adjacent teeth.\\nTooth avulsion:\\n Avulsed primary teeth are not replaced because they typically become necrotic, then\\ninfected. They may also become ankylosed and do not exfoliate, thereby interfering with the eruption of\\nthe permanent tooth.\\nIf a secondary tooth is avulsed, the patient should replace it in its socket immediately and seek dental\\ncare to stabilize it. If this cannot be done, the tooth should be kept immersed in milk or wrapped in a\\nmoistened paper towel and brought to a dentist for replacement and stabilization. The tooth should not be\\nscrubbed, because scrubbing may remove viable periodontal ligament fibers, which aid in reattachment. A\\npatient with an avulsed tooth should take an antibiotic for several days. If the avulsed tooth cannot be\\nfound, it may have been aspirated, embedded in soft tissue, or swallowed. A chest x-ray may be needed\\nto rule out aspiration, but a swallowed tooth is harmless.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 58. Dental Emergencies\\n629'),\n",

When replacement of the tooth is delayed, the long-term\\nretention rate drops, and root resorption eventually occurs. Nevertheless, a patient may be able to use\\nthe tooth for several years.\\nMandibular Dislocation\\nSpontaneous mandibular dislocation usually occurs in people with a history of such dislocations. Although\\na dislocated mandible is occasionally caused by trauma, the initiating episode is typically a wide opening\\nfollowed by biting pressure (eg, biting into a large\\n[\\nFig. 58-1.\\n Mandibular reduction.]\\nsandwich with hard bread), a wide yawn, or a dental procedure. People prone to dislocation may have\\nnaturally loose temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ligaments.\\nPatients present with a wide-open mouth that they are unable to close. Pain is secondary to patients'\\nattempts to close the mouth. If the mandibular midline deviates to one side, the dislocation is unilateral.\\nAlthough rarely used, a local anesthetic (eg, 2% lidocaine 2 to 5 mL) injected into the ipsilateral joint and\\ninto the adjacent area of insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle may allow the mandible to reduce\\nspontaneously.\\nManual reduction may be necessary (see \\nFig. 58-1\\n). Premedication may be used (eg, diazepam 5 to 10\\nmg IV at 5 mg/min or midazolam 3 to 5 mg IV at 2 mg/min and an opioid such as meperidine 25 mg IV or\\nfentanyl 0.5 to 1 \\nμ\\ng/kg IV) but is usually unnecessary, especially if time will be lost preparing the IV. The\\nlonger the mandible is dislocated, the more difficult it is to reduce and the greater the likelihood that\\ndislocation will recur.\\nBarton's bandage may be needed for 2 or 3 days. Most importantly, the patient must avoid opening the\\nmouth wide for at least 6 wk. When anticipating a yawn, the patient should place a fist under the chin to\\nprevent wide opening. Food must be cut into small pieces. If the patient suffers from chronic dislocations\\nand more conservative treatment modalities have been exhausted, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon may\\nbe consulted. As last-resort treatments, the ligaments around the TMJ can be surgically tightened\\n(shortened) in an attempt to stabilize the joint or the articular eminence can be reduced (eminectomy).\\nPostextraction Problems\\nPain and swelling:\\n Swelling is normal after oral surgery and is proportional to the degree of\\nmanipulation and trauma.

Although assumed to be due to bacterial action, it is much more common among\\nsmokers and oral contraceptive users. It is peculiar to the removal of mandibular molars, usually wisdom\\nteeth. Typically, the pain begins on the 2nd or 3rd postoperative day, is referred to the ear, and lasts from\\na few days to many weeks. Alveolitis is best treated with topical analgesics: a 1- to 2-in iodoform gauze\\nstrip saturated in eugenol or coated with an anesthetic ointment, such as lidocaine 2.5% or tetracaine\\n0.5%, is placed in the socket. The gauze is changed every 1 to 3 days until symptoms do not return after\\nthe gauze is left out for a few hours.

Recently, an association has been discovered between IV\\nbisphosphonate (BP) use and ONJ. However, oral BP therapy seems to pose very low risk of ONJ.\\nStopping oral BP therapy is unlikely to reduce this already low rate of ONJ, and maintaining good oral\\nhygiene is a more effective preventative measure than stopping oral BP before dental procedures.\\nManagement of ONJ is challenging and typically involves limited debridement, antibiotics, and oral rinses.\\nBleeding:\\n Postextraction bleeding usually occurs in the small vessels. Any clots extending out of the\\nsocket are removed with gauze, and a 4-in gauze pad (folded) or a tea bag is placed over the socket.\\nThen the patient is instructed to apply continuous pressure by biting for 1 h. The procedure may have to\\nbe repeated 2 or 3 times. Patients are told to wait at least 1 h before checking the site so as not to disrupt\\nclot formation. They also are informed that a few drops of blood diluted in a mouth full of saliva appear to\\nbe more blood than is actually present. If bleeding continues, the site may be anesthetized by nerve block\\nor local infiltration with 2% lidocaine containing 1:100,000 epinephrine. The socket is then curetted to\\nremove the existing clot and to freshen the bone and is irrigated with normal saline. Then the area is\\nsutured under gentle tension. Local hemostatic agents, such as oxidized cellulose, topical thrombin on a\\ngelatin sponge, or microfibrillar collagen, may be placed in the socket before suturing.\\nIf possible, patients taking low-dose anticoagulants (eg, aspirin, clopedigrol, warfarin) should stop therapy\\n3 to 4 days before surgery. Therapy can be reinstated that evening. If these measures fail, a systemic\\ncause (eg, bleeding diathesis) is sought.\\nToothache and Infection\\nPain in and around the teeth is a common problem, particularly among those with poor oral hygiene. Pain\\nmay be constant, felt after stimulation (eg, heat, cold, sweet food or drink, chewing, brushing), or both.\\nEtiology\\nThe most common causes of toothache (see\\nTable 58-1\\n) are\\n• Dental caries\\n• Pulpitis\\n• Trauma\\n• Erupting wisdom tooth (causing pericoronitis)\\nToothache is usually caused by dental caries and its consequences.\\nCaries causes pain when the lesion extends through the enamel into dentin. Pain usually occurs after\\nstimulation from cold, heat, sweet food or drink, or brushing; these stimuli cause fluid to move along\\ndentinal tubules to the pulp. As long as the discomfort does not persist after the stimulus is removed, the\\npulp is likely healthy enough to be maintained. This is referred to as normal dentinal sensitivity, reversible\\npulpalgia, or reversible pulpitis.\\nPulpitis is inflammation of the pulp, typically due to advancing caries, cumulative minor pulp damage from\\nprevious large restorations, a defective restoration, or trauma. It may be reversible or irreversible.\\nPressure necrosis frequently results from pulpitis, because the pulp is encased in a rigid compartment.\\nPain may be spontaneous or in response to stimulation. In both cases, pain lingers for a minute or longer.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 58. Dental Emergencies\\n631'),\n",

Temporomandibular Disorders\\nIntroduction\\n(See also \\nMandibular Dislocation\\n on p. \\n524\\n, \\nTemporal Bone Fractures\\n on p. \\n3234\\n, and \\nJaw Tumors\\n on p.\\n489\\n.)\\nThe term temporomandibular disorders is an umbrella term for conditions causing dysfunction of the jaw\\njoint or pain in the jaw and face, often in or around the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), including\\nmasticatory and other muscles of the head and neck, the fascia, or both. A person is considered to have a\\ntemporomandibular disorder only if pain or limitation of motion is severe enough to require professional\\ncare.\\nTemporomandibular disorders typically are multifactorial, but most are related to problems with muscles or\\njoints. Internal derangements of the TMJ cause disturbed movement of the mandibular condyle in the\\nglenoid fossa or against the cartilaginous articular disk (see\\nFig. 59-1\\n). This disk, shaped like a donut with a closed hole or like a mature red blood cell, serves as a\\ncushion between joint surfaces. Causes for this disturbed movement include clenching and grinding of\\nthe teeth, trauma, arthritis, and malocclusion and missing teeth. Even the trauma of persistent gum\\nchewing can be enough to damage the joint.\\nDiagnosis\\nDisorders of the TMJ must be distinguished from the many conditions that mimic them (see\\nTable 59-1\\n). Pain exacerbated by finger pressure on the joint when the mouth is opened implicates the\\nTMJ.\\nPatients are asked to describe the pain and designate painful areas. The cervical and occipital muscles\\nand each of the major muscle groups involved in mastication are palpated for general tenderness and\\ntrigger points (spots\\n[\\nFig. 59-1.\\n The temporomandibular joint.]\\nthat radiate pain to another area). Patients are observed opening the mouth as wide as is comfortable.\\nWhen patients open and close their mouth with the junction of the maxillary and mandibular central\\nincisors (normally in the midline) lined up against a vertical straight edge, the mandibular midline typically\\ndeviates toward the painful side. Palpation and auscultation of the joint during opening and closing may\\nreveal tenderness, catching, clicking, or popping. Condylar motion can best be palpated by placing the\\n5th fingers into the external ear canals and exerting very gentle forward pressure as patients move the\\njaw. The average-sized patient can open the mouth at least 40 to 45 mm (measured between upper and\\nlower central incisors). To account for differences in patient size, a patient should be able to fit 3 fingers\\n(index, middle, ring) in the mouth on top of each other.\\nAnkylosis of the Temporomandibular Joint\\nAnkylosis of the TMJ is immobility or fusion of the joint.\\nAnkylosis of the TMJ most often results from trauma or infection, but it may be congenital or a result of\\nRA. Chronic, painless limitation of motion occurs. When ankylosis leads to arrest of condylar growth,\\nfacial asymmetry is common (see \\nCondylar Hyperplasia\\n on p. \\n532\\n). Intra-articular (true) ankylosis must be\\ndistinguished from extra-articular (false) ankylosis, which may be caused by enlargement of the coronoid\\nprocess, depressed fracture of the zygomatic arch, or scarring resulting from surgery, irradiation, or\\ninfection. In most cases of true ankylosis, x-rays of the joint show loss of normal bony architecture.\\nTreatment may include a condylectomy if the ankylosis is intra-articular or an ostectomy of part of the\\nramus if the coronoid process and zygomatic arch are also affected. Jaw-opening exercises must be done\\nfor months to years to maintain the surgical correction, but forced opening of the jaws without surgery is\\ngenerally ineffective because of bony fusion.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 59.

The area\\nis inflamed, and jaw movement is limited. Local signs of infection associated with evidence of a systemic\\ndisease or with an adjacent infection suggest the diagnosis. X-ray results are negative in the early stages\\nbut may show bone destruction later. If suppurative arthritis is suspected, the joint is aspirated to confirm\\nthe diagnosis and to identify the causative organism. Diagnosis must be made rapidly to prevent\\npermanent joint damage.\\n[\\nTable 59-1.\\n Some Conditions that Mimic Temporomandibular Disorders]\\nTreatment includes antibiotics, proper hydration, pain control, and motion restriction. Parenteral penicillin\\nG is the drug of choice until a specific bacteriologic diagnosis can be made on the basis of culture and\\nsensitivity testing. Suppurative infections are aspirated or incised. Once the infection is controlled, jaw-\\nopening exercises help prevent scarring and limitation of motion.\\nTraumatic arthritis:\\n Rarely, acute injury (eg, due to difficult tooth extraction or endotracheal intubation)\\nmay lead to arthritis of the TMJ. Pain, tenderness, and limitation of motion occur. Diagnosis is based\\nprimarily on history. X-ray results are negative except when intra-articular edema or hemorrhage widens\\nthe joint space. Treatment includes NSAIDs, application of heat, a soft diet, and restriction of jaw\\nmovement.\\nOsteoarthritis:\\n The TMJ may be affected, usually in people > 50 yr. Occasionally, patients complain of\\nstiffness, grating, or mild pain. Crepitus results from a hole worn through the disk, causing bone to grate\\non bone. Joint involvement is generally bilateral. X-rays or CT may show flattening and lipping of the\\ncondyle, suggestive of dysfunctional change. Treatment is symptomatic.\\nRheumatoid arthritis:\\n The TMJ is affected in > 17% of adults and children with RA, but it is usually\\namong the last joints involved. Pain, swelling, and limited movement are the most common findings. In\\nchildren, destruction of the condyle results in mandibular growth disturbance and facial deformity.\\nAnkylosis may follow. X-rays of the TMJ are usually negative in early stages but later show bone\\ndestruction, which may result in an anterior open-bite deformity. The diagnosis is suggested by TMJ\\ninflammation associated with polyarthritis and is confirmed by other findings typical of the disease.\\nTreatment is similar to that of RA in other joints. In the acute stage, NSAIDs may be given, and jaw\\nfunction should be restricted. A night guard or splint is often helpful. When symptoms subside, mild jaw\\nexercises help prevent excessive loss of motion. Surgery is necessary if ankylosis develops but should\\nnot be done until the condition is quiescent.\\nSecondary degenerative arthritis:\\n This type of arthritis usually develops in people aged 20 to 40 after\\ntrauma or in people with persistent myofascial pain syndrome (see p. \\n533\\n). It is characterized by limited\\nopening of the mouth, unilateral pain during jaw movement, joint tenderness, and crepitus. When it is\\nassociated with the myofascial pain syndrome, symptoms wax and wane. Diagnosis is based on x-rays,\\nwhich generally show condylar flattening, lipping, spurring, or erosion. Unilateral joint involvement helps\\ndistinguish secondary degenerative arthritis from osteoarthritis.\\nTreatment is conservative, as it is for myofascial pain syndrome, although arthroplasty or high\\ncondylectomy may be necessary. An occlusal splint (mouth guard) usually relieves symptoms. The splint\\nis worn constantly, except during meals, oral hygiene, and appliance \\ncleaning. When symptoms resolve,\\nthe length of time that the splint is worn each day is gradually reduced.

The condyle remains on the disk\\nduring further opening. Usually, another click is heard during closing when the condyle slips over the\\nposterior rim of the disk and the disk slips forward (reciprocal clicking).\\nDiagnosis of derangement without reduction requires that the patient open as wide as possible. The\\nopening is measured, and gentle pressure is then exerted to open the mouth a little wider. Normally, the\\njaw opens about 45 to 50 mm; if the disk is deranged, it will open about 20 mm. Closing or protruding the\\njaw against resistance worsens the pain.\\nMRI is usually done to confirm presence of derangement or to determine why a patient is not responding\\nto treatment.\\nCapsulitis is often diagnosed based on a history of injury or infection along with exquisite tenderness over\\nthe joint and by exclusion when pain remains after treatment for myofascial pain syndrome, disk\\nderangement, arthritis, and structural asymmetries.

Conservative treatment, including analgesics, muscle relaxation, habit\\nmodification, and bite splinting, usually is effective.\\nThis syndrome is the most common disorder affecting the temporomandibular region. It is \\nmore common\\namong women and has a bimodal age distribution in the early 20s and around menopause. The muscle\\nspasm causing the disorder usually is the result of nocturnal bruxism (clenching or grinding of the teeth).\\nWhether bruxism is caused by irregular tooth contacts, emotional stress, or sleep disorders is\\ncontroversial. Bruxism usually has a multifactorial etiology. Myofascial pain syndrome is not limited to the\\nmuscles of mastication. It can occur anywhere in the body, most commonly involving muscles in the neck\\nand back.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms include pain and tenderness of the masticatory muscles and often pain and limitation of jaw\\nexcursion. Nocturnal bruxism may lead to headache that is more severe on awakening and that gradually\\nsubsides during the day. Such pain should be distinguished from temporal arteritis. Daytime symptoms,\\nincluding headache, may worsen if bruxism continues throughout the day.\\nThe jaw deviates when the mouth opens but usually not as suddenly or always at the same point of\\nopening as it does with internal joint derangement (see p. \\n532\\n). Exerting gentle pressure, the examiner\\ncan open the patient's mouth another 1 to 3 mm beyond unaided maximum opening.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nA simple test may aid the diagnosis: Tongue blades of 2 or 3 thicknesses are placed between the rear\\nmolars on each side, and the patient is asked to bite down gently.

Approach to the Ophthalmologic Patient\\nIntroduction\\nThe eye can be examined with routine equipment, including a standard ophthalmoscope; thorough\\nexamination requires special equipment and evaluation by an ophthalmologist. (See\\nFig. 60-1\\n for a cross-section of the eye.)\\nHistory\\nHistory includes location, speed of onset, and duration of current symptoms and history of previous\\nocular symptoms; the presence and nature of pain, discharge, or redness; and changes in visual acuity.\\nWorrisome symptoms besides vision loss and eye pain include flashing lights, showers of floaters (both of\\nwhich may be symptoms of retinal detachment), diplopia, and loss of peripheral vision.\\nPhysical Examination\\nVisual acuity:\\n The first step is to record visual acuity. Many patients do not give a full effort. Providing\\nadequate time and coaxing patients tend to yield more accurate results. Visual acuity is measured with\\nand without the patient's own glasses. If patients do not have their glasses, a pinhole refractor is used. If\\na commercial pinhole refractor is unavailable, one can be made at the bedside by poking holes through a\\npiece of cardboard using an 18-gauge needle and varying the diameter of each hole slightly. Patients\\nchoose the hole that corrects vision the most. If acuity corrects with pinhole refraction, the problem is a\\nrefractive error. Pinhole refraction is a rapid, efficient way to diagnose refractive errors, which are the\\nmost common cause of blurred vision. However, with pinhole refraction, best correction is usually to only\\nabout 20/30, not 20/20.\\n[\\nFig. 60-1.\\n Cross-section of the eye.]\\nVisual acuity in each eye is tested as the opposite eye is covered with a solid object (not the patient's\\nfingers, which may separate during testing). Patients look at an eye chart 20 ft (6 m) away. If this test\\ncannot be done, acuity can be measured using a chart held about 36 cm (14 in) from the eye. Normal and\\nabnormal vision is quantified by Snellen notation. A Snellen notation of 20/40 (6/12) indicates that the\\nsmallest letter that can be read by someone with normal vision at 40 ft (12 m) has to be brought to 20 ft (6\\nm) before it is recognized by the patient. Vision is recorded as the smallest letter patients read correctly,\\neven if patients feel that the letter is blurry or they have to guess. If the patient cannot read the top line of\\nthe Snellen chart at 20 ft (6 m), acuity is tested at 10 ft (3 m). If nothing can be read from a chart even at\\nthe closest distance, the examiner holds up different numbers of fingers to see whether the patient can\\naccurately count them. If not, the examiner tests whether the patient can perceive hand motion. If not, a\\nlight is shined into the eye to see whether light is perceived.\\nNear vision is checked by asking patients to read a standard near card or newsprint at 14 in (35 cm);\\npatients > 40 yr who require corrective lenses (reading glasses) should wear them during near vision\\ntesting.\\nRefractive error can be estimated roughly with a handheld ophthalmoscope by noting the lens necessary\\nfor the examiner to focus on the retina; this procedure requires examiners to use their own corrective\\nlenses and is never a substitute for a comprehensive assessment of refraction. More commonly, refractive\\nerror is measured with a standard phoropter or an automated refractor (a device that measures changes\\nin light projected and reflected by the patient's eye). These devices also measure astigmatism (see p.\\n571\\n).\\nEyelid and conjunctival examination:\\n Eyelid margins and periocular cutaneous tissues are examined\\nunder a focal light and magnification (eg, provided by loupe, slit lamp, or ophthalmoscope focused at the\\nexaminer's working distance). In cases of suspected dacryocystitis or canaliculitis, the lacrimal sacs are\\npalpated and an attempt is made to express any contents through the canaliculi and puncta.

Fluorescein staining reveals abrasions and ulcers. Before staining, a drop of\\ntopical anesthetic (eg, proparacaine 0.5%, tetracaine 0.5%) may be added to facilitate examination if the\\npatient is in pain or if it is necessary to touch the cornea or conjunctiva (eg, to remove a foreign body or\\nmeasure intraocular pressure). A sterile, individually packaged fluorescein strip is moistened with 1 drop\\nof sterile saline or topical anesthetic and, with the patient's eye turned upward, is touched momentarily to\\nthe inside of the lower eyelid. The patient blinks several times to spread the dye into the tear film, and\\nthen the eye is examined under magnification and cobalt blue illumination. Areas where corneal or\\nconjunctival epithelium is absent (abraded or ulcerated) fluoresce green.\\nPupil examination:\\n The size and shape of the pupils are noted, and pupillary reaction to light is tested\\nin each eye, one at a time, while the patient looks in the distance. Then the swinging flashlight test is\\ndone with a penlight to compare direct and consensual pupillary response. There are 3 steps:\\n1.\\n One pupil is maximally constricted by being exposed to light from the penlight for 1 to 3 sec.\\n2.\\n The penlight is rapidly moved to the other eye for 1 to 3 sec.\\n3.\\n The light is moved back to the first eye.\\nNormally, a pupil constricts similarly when light is shone on it (direct response) and when light is shone on\\nthe other eye (consensual response). However, if one eye has less light perception than the other, as\\ncaused by dysfunction of the afferent limb (from the optic nerve to the optic chiasm) or extensive retinal\\ndisease, then the \\nconsensual\\n response in the affected eye is stronger than the \\ndirect\\n response. Thus, on\\nstep 3 of the swinging light test, when the light is shined back on the affected eye, it paradoxically\\nappears to dilate. This finding indicates a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD, or Marcus Gunn pupil).\\nExtraocular muscles:\\n The examiner guides the patient to look in 8 directions (up, up and right, right,\\ndown and right, down, down and left, left, left and up) with a moving finger, penlight, or transillumination\\nlight, observing for gaze deviation, limitation of movement, disconjugate gaze, or a combination consistent\\nwith cranial nerve palsy, orbital disease, or other abnormalities that restrict movement.\\nOphthalmoscopy:\\n Ophthalmoscopy can be done directly by using a handheld ophthalmoscope or\\nindirectly by using a head-mounted \\nophthalmoscope with a handheld lens. With handheld\\nophthalmoscopy, the examiner dials the ophthalmoscope to zero diopters, then increases or decreases\\nthe setting until the fundus comes into focus. The view of the retina is limited with a handheld\\nophthalmoscope, whereas indirect ophthalmoscopy gives a 3-dimensional view and is better for\\nvisualizing the peripheral retina, where retinal detachment most commonly occurs. The view of the fundus\\ncan be improved by dilating the pupils. Before dilation, the anterior chamber depth is estimated because\\nmydriasis can precipitate an attack of acute angle-closure glaucoma if the anterior chamber is shallow.\\nDepth can be estimated with a slit lamp (see below) or less accurately with a penlight held at the temporal\\nlimbus parallel to the plane of the iris and pointed toward the nose. If the medial iris is in shadow, the\\nchamber is shallow and dilation should be avoided. Other contraindications to dilation include head\\ntrauma, suspicion of a ruptured globe, a narrow angle, and angle-closure glaucoma.\\nPupils can be dilated using 1 drop of tropicamide 1%, phenylephrine 2.5%, or both (repeated in 5 to 10\\nmin if necessary); for longer action, a larger dilated pupil, or both, cyclopentolate 1% can be substituted\\nfor tropicamide.\\nOphthalmoscopy can detect lens or vitreous opacities, assess the optic cup-to-disk ratio, and identify\\nretinal and vascular changes. The optic cup is the central depression, and the optic disk is the entire area\\nof the optic nerve head. The normal ratio of the cup-to-nerve diameters is 0 to 0.4.

The examiner\\nbrings a small target (eg, a match or a finger) from the patients' visual periphery into each of the 4 visual\\nquadrants and asks patients to indicate when they first see the object. Wiggling the small target helps\\npatients separate and define it. Another method of direct confrontation visual field testing is to hold a\\nnumber of fingers in each quadrant and ask patients how many they see. For both methods, each eye is\\ntested separately. Abnormalities in target detection should prompt detailed testing with more precise\\ninstruments.\\nMore detailed methods include use of a tangent screen, Goldmann perimeter, or computerized automated\\nperimetry (in which the visual field is mapped out in detail based on patient response to a series of\\nflashing lights in different locations controlled by a standardized computer program). The Amsler grid is\\nused to test central vision. Distortion of the grid (metamorphopsia) or a missing area (central scotoma)\\nmay indicate disease of the macula (eg, choroidal neovascularization), as occurs in age-related macular\\ndegeneration.\\nColor vision testing:\\n Twelve to 24 Ishihara color plates, which have colored numbers or symbols hidden\\nin a field of colored dots, are commonly used to test color vision.

For example, loss of detail is not the same as loss of contrast. Also, visual field defects may not\\nbe recognized as such by patients, who may instead describe symptoms such as missing steps or the\\ninability to see words when reading. Important associated symptoms include eye redness, photophobia,\\nfloaters, sensation of lightning-like flashes of light (photopsias), and pain at rest or with eye movement.\\nThe effects of darkness (night vision), bright lights (ie, causing blur, star bursts, halos, photophobia),\\ndistance from an object, and corrective lenses and whether central or peripheral vision seems to be more\\naffected should be ascertained.\\nReview of systems\\n includes questions about symptoms of possible causes, such as increased thirst\\nand polyuria (diabetes).\\nPast medical history\\n should note previous eye injury or other diagnosed eye disorders and ask about\\ndisorders known to be risk factors for eye disorders (eg, hypertension, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, SLE, sickle\\ncell anemia, disorders that could cause hyperviscosity syndrome such as multiple myeloma or\\nWaldenstrom\\'s macroglobulinemia). Drug history should include questions about use of drugs that could\\naffect vision (eg, amiodarone, corticosteroids) and treatments for disorders affecting vision (eg, diabetic\\nretinopathy).\\nPhysical examination:\\n Nonvisual symptoms are evaluated as needed; however, examination of the\\neyes may be all that is necessary.\\nTesting \\nvisual acuity\\n is key. Many patients do not give a full effort. Providing adequate time and coaxing\\npatients tend to yield more accurate results.\\nAcuity ideally is measured while the patient stands 6 m (about 20 ft) from a Snellen chart posted on a\\nwall. If this test cannot be done, acuity can be measured using a chart held about 36 cm (14 in) from the\\neye. Measurement of near vision should be done with reading correction in place for patients > age 40.\\nEach eye is measured separately while the other eye is covered with a solid object (not the patient\\'s\\nfingers, which may separate during testing). If the patient cannot read the top line of the Snellen chart at\\n6 m, acuity is tested at 3 m. If nothing can be read from a chart even at the closest distance, the examiner\\nholds up different numbers of fingers to see whether the patient can accurately count them. If not, the\\nexaminer tests whether the patient can perceive hand motion. If not, a light is shined into the eye to see\\nwhether light is perceived.\\nVisual acuity is measured with and without the patients\\' own glasses. If acuity is corrected\\n[\\nTable 60-4.\\n Some Causes of Blurred Vision]\\nwith glasses, the problem is a refractive error. If patients do not have their glasses, a pinhole refractor is\\nused. If a commercial pinhole refractor is unavailable, one can be made at the bedside by poking holes\\nthrough a piece of cardboard using an 18-gauge needle and varying the diameter of each hole slightly.\\nPatients choose the hole that corrects vision the most. If acuity corrects with pinhole refraction, the\\nproblem is a refractive error. Pinhole refraction is a rapid, efficient way to diagnose refractive errors,\\nwhich are the most common cause of blurred vision. However, with pinhole refraction, best correction is\\nusually to only about 20/30, not 20/20.\\nEye examination\\n is also important. Direct and consensual pupillary light responses are examined using\\nthe swinging flashlight test. Visual fields are checked using confrontation and an Amsler grid.\\nThe cornea is examined for opacification, ideally using a slit lamp. The anterior chamber is examined for\\ncells and flare using a slit lamp if possible, although results of this examination are unlikely to explain\\nvisual blurring in patients without eye pain or redness.\\nThe lens is examined for opacities using an ophthalmoscope, slit lamp, or both.\\nOphthalmoscopy is done using a direct ophthalmoscope. More detail is visible if the eyes are dilated for\\nophthalmoscopy with a drop of a sympathomimetic (eg, 2.5% phenylephrine), cycloplegic (eg, 1%\\ntropicamide or 1% cyclopentolate), or both; dilation is nearly full after about 20 min.

Exophthalmos means the same thing, and this term is usually used\\nwhen describing proptosis due to Grave's disease. Disorders that may cause changes in the appearance\\nof the face and eyes that resemble proptosis but are not include hyperthyroidism without infiltrative eye\\ndisease, Cushing's disease, and severe obesity.\\nEtiology\\nThe \\nmost common cause\\n is Graves' disease (see\\nTable 60-10\\n), which causes edema and lymphoid infiltration of the orbital tissues.\\nEvaluation\\nRate of onset may provide a clue to diagnosis. Sudden unilateral onset suggests intraorbital hemorrhage\\n(which can occur after surgery, retrobulbar injection, or trauma) or inflammation of the orbit or paranasal\\nsinuses. A 2- to 3-wk onset suggests chronic inflammation or orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (non-\\nneoplastic cellular infiltration and proliferation); slower onset suggests an orbital tumor.\\nOcular examination findings typical of hyperthyroidism but unrelated to infiltrative eye disease include\\neyelid retraction, eyelid lag, temporal flare of the upper eyelid, and staring. Other signs include eyelid\\nerythema and conjunctival hyperemia. Prolonged exposure of larger-than-usual areas of the eyeball to air\\ncauses corneal drying and can lead to infection and ulceration.\\nTesting:\\n Proptosis can be confirmed with exophthalmometry, which measures the distance between the\\nlateral angle of the bony orbit and the cornea; normal values are < 20 mm in whites and < 22 mm in\\nblacks. CT or MRI is often useful to confirm the diagnosis and to identify structural causes of unilateral\\nproptosis. Thyroid function testing is indicated when Graves' disease is suspected.\\n[\\nTable 60-10.\\n Some Causes of Proptosis]\\nTreatment\\nLubrication to protect the cornea is required in severe cases. When lubrication is not sufficient, surgery to\\nprovide better coverage of the eye surface or to reduce proptosis may be required. Systemic\\ncorticosteroids (eg, prednisone 1 mg/kg po once/day for 1 wk, tapered over ≥ 1 mo) are often helpful in\\ncontrolling edema and orbital congestion due to thyroid eye disease or inflammatory orbital pseudotumor.\\nOther interventions vary by etiology. Graves' exophthalmos is not affected by treatment of the thyroid\\ncondition but may lessen over time. Tumors must be surgically removed.

Refractive Error\\nIntroduction\\nIn the emmetropic (normally refracted) eye, entering light rays are focused on the retina by the cornea\\nand the lens, creating a sharp image that is transmitted to the brain. The lens is elastic, more so in\\nyounger people. During accommodation, the ciliary muscles adjust lens shape to properly focus images.\\nRefractive errors are failure of the eye to focus images sharply on the retina, causing blurred vision (see\\nFig. 61-1\\n).\\nIn \\nmyopia\\n (nearsightedness), the point of focus is in front of the retina because the cornea is too steeply\\ncurved, the axial length of the eye is too long, or both. Distant objects are blurred, but near objects can be\\nseen clearly. To correct myopia, a concave (minus) lens is used. Myopic refractive errors in children\\nfrequently increase until the child stops growing.\\nIn \\nhyperopia\\n (farsightedness), the point of focus is behind the retina because the cornea is too flatly\\ncurved, the axial length is too short, or both. In adults, both near and distant objects are blurred. Children\\nand young adults with mild hyperopia may be able to see clearly because of their ability to accommodate.\\nTo correct hyperopia, a convex (plus) lens is used.\\n[\\nFig. 61-1.\\n Errors of refraction.]\\nIn \\nastigmatism,\\n nonspherical (variable) curvature of the cornea or lens causes light rays of different\\norientations (eg, vertical, oblique, horizontal) to focus at different points. To correct astigmatism, a\\ncylindric lens (a segment cut from a cylinder) is used. Cylindric lenses have no refractive power along one\\naxis and are concave or convex along the other axis.\\nPresbyopia\\n is loss of the lens' ability to change shape to focus on near objects due to aging. Typically,\\npresbyopia becomes noticeable by the time a person reaches the early or mid 40s. A convex (plus) lens is\\nused for correction when viewing near objects. These lenses may be supplied as separate glasses or\\nbuilt into a lens as bifocals or variable focus lenses.\\nAnisometropia\\n is a significant difference between the refractive errors of the 2 eyes (usually > 3\\ndiopters). When corrected with eyeglasses, a difference in image size (aniseikonia) is produced; it can\\nlead to difficulties with fusion of the 2 differently sized images and even to suppression of one of the\\nimages.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe primary symptom of refractive errors is blurred vision for distant objects, near objects, or both.\\nSometimes the excessive ciliary muscle tone can cause headaches. Occasionally, excessive staring can\\nlead to ocular surface desiccation, causing eye irritation, itching, visual fatigue, foreign body sensation,\\nand redness. Frowning when reading and excessive blinking or rubbing of the eyes are symptoms in\\nchildren.\\nDiagnosis\\nRefraction should be checked every 1 or 2 yr. Screening children helps detect refractive errors before\\nthey interfere with learning. A comprehensive eye examination (see p. \\n537\\n) should accompany refraction\\ntesting, whether done by an ophthalmologist or an optometrist.\\nContact Lenses\\nContact lenses often provide better visual acuity and peripheral vision than do eyeglasses and can be\\nprescribed to correct myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, anisometropia, aniseikonia, aphakia (absence of\\nthe lens) after cataract removal, and keratoconus (a conical-shaped cornea). Either soft or rigid lenses\\nare used to correct myopia and hyperopia.

Poor contact lens hygiene may\\nlead to persistent inflammation or infection of the cornea.\\nContact lenses occasionally cause painless superficial corneal changes. Contact lenses can be painful\\nwhen\\n• The corneal epithelium is abraded (see p. \\n3236\\n); the cornea becomes red and inflamed and stains with\\nfluorescein.\\n• The lenses fit poorly (eg, too tight, too loose, poorly centered).\\n• There is too little moisture to keep the lens floating above the cornea.\\n• The lenses are worn in a nonideal environment (eg, O\\n2\\n-poor, smoky, windy).\\n• A lens is improperly inserted or removed.\\n• A small foreign particle (eg, soot, dust) becomes trapped between the lens and the cornea.\\n• The lenses are worn for a long time (overwear syndrome).\\nIn overwear syndrome, spontaneous healing may occur in a day or so if lenses are not worn. In some\\ncases, active treatment is required—eg, topical antibiotic eyedrops or ointments and dilation of the pupil\\nwith a mydriatic to ease photophobia. (Mydriatics work by paralyzing the muscles of the iris and ciliary\\nbody [movement of the inflamed muscles causes pain].) Recovery is usually rapid, complete, and without\\nvision impairment. An ophthalmologist should be consulted before lenses are worn again.\\nRisk factors for contact lens-related corneal infection (keratitis) include the following:\\n• Poor lens hygiene\\n• Overnight or extended wear\\n• Use of tap water in the cleaning regimen\\n• Eyes with a compromised ocular surface (eg, dryness, poor corneal sensation)\\nInfections require rapid management by an ophthalmologist.\\nCorneal ulcer:\\n A corneal ulcer, which is a potentially vision-threatening infection of the cornea, is\\nsuspected when a contact lens wearer experiences intense eye pain (both foreign body sensation and\\nache), redness, photophobia, and tearing (see also p. \\n588\\n).\\nDiagnosis is by slit-lamp examination and fluorescein staining.

Initial therapy includes broad-\\nspectrum antibiotic coverage using a fluoroquinolone antibiotic drop q 15 to 60 min around the clock for\\n24 to 72 h, then at gradually longer intervals. Drops of an additional antibiotic, such as cefazolin,\\nvancomycin, or concentrated tobramycin, are used if the ulcer is large, deep, or close to the visual axis.\\nThe antibiotic may be changed later based on culture results. Neglected cases may respond poorly or not\\nat all to treatment, and severe vision loss may result.\\nRigid Corneal Contact Lenses\\nOlder polymethyl methacrylate rigid contact lenses have been replaced by gas-permeable contact lenses\\n(GPCLs) made of fluorocarbon and polymethyl methacrylate admixtures. GPCLs are 6.5 to 10 mm in\\ndiameter and cover part of the cornea, floating on the tear layer overlying it.\\nRigid contact lenses can improve vision for people with myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. If the\\ncorneal surface is irregular, rigid lenses often provide a smooth refracting surface and thus improve visual\\nacuity noticeably more than soft contact lenses or eyeglasses.\\nFor complete wearing comfort, rigid contact lenses require an adaptation period, sometimes as long as 1\\nwk. During this time, the wearer gradually increases the number of hours the lenses are worn each day.\\nImportantly, no pain should occur at any time. Pain is a sign of an ill-fitting contact lens or corneal\\nirritation. Wearers usually experience temporary (< 2 h) blurred vision (spectacle blur) when wearing\\neyeglasses after removing rigid contact lenses.\\nSoft Hydrophilic Contact Lenses\\nSoft contact lenses are made of poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and other flexible plastics and are 30 to\\n79% water. They are 13 to 15 mm in diameter and cover the entire cornea. Soft contact lenses can\\nimprove vision for people with myopia and hyperopia. Because soft contact lenses mold to the existing\\ncorneal curvature, anything greater than minimal astigmatism cannot be treated unless a special toric\\nlens, which has different curvatures molded onto the front lens surface, is used. Weighting the lower\\naspect of the lens maintains its orientation.\\nSoft contact lenses are also prescribed for treatment of recurrent corneal erosions and other corneal\\ndisorders (called bandage or therapeutic contact lenses). Prophylactic antibiotic eyedrops (eg,\\nfluoroquinolone qid) may be advisable with a bandage lens. Extended wearing of contact lenses,\\nespecially in aphakia after cataract surgery, is practical, but an ophthalmologist should examine the\\npatient at least 4 times/yr. The patient should clean the lenses once/wk.\\nBecause of their larger size, soft contact lenses are easier to handle, are not as likely as rigid lenses to\\neject spontaneously, and are less likely to allow foreign bodies to lodge beneath them. Immediate wearing\\ncomfort allows for a brief adaptation period.\\nSoft contact lenses have a higher incidence of corneal infections, which increases for every night a\\nperson wears them during sleep. When dry, soft contact lenses are brittle and break easily. They absorb a\\ncertain amount of moisture (based on the water content) from the tear film to retain adequate shape and\\npliability. Therefore, patients with dry eye are usually more comfortable wearing lenses that have a low\\nwater content.\\nRefractive Surgery\\nCorneal refractive surgery alters the curvature of the cornea to focus light more precisely on the retina.\\nThe goal of refractive surgery is to decrease dependence on eyeglasses or contact lenses. Most people\\nwho undergo refractive surgery achieve this goal; about 95% do not need corrective lenses for distance\\nvision. Ideal candidates for refractive surgery are people with healthy eyes who are not satisfied wearing\\neyeglasses or contact lenses.

Potential complications include overcorrection and undercorrection,\\ninfection, and irregular astigmatism. In excimer laser procedures performed on the superficial corneal\\nstroma, haze formation is possible. If infection, irregular astigmatism, or haze formation causes permanent\\nchanges in the central cornea, best-corrected acuity could be lost. The overall complication rate is low;\\nchance of vision loss is < 1% if the patient is considered a good candidate for refractive surgery\\npreoperatively.\\nLaser In Situ Keratomileusis\\nIn laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), a flap of corneal tissue is created with a laser or mechanical\\nmicrokeratome and turned back, the underlying stromal bed is sculpted (photo-ablated) with the excimer\\nlaser, and the flap is replaced without suturing. Because surface epithelium is not disrupted centrally,\\nvision returns rapidly. Most people notice a significant improvement the next day. LASIK can be used to\\ntreat myopia, astigmatism, and hyperopia.\\nAdvantages of LASIK over photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) include the desirable lack of healing\\nresponse (the central corneal epithelium is not removed, thereby decreasing the risk of central haze\\nformation that occurs during healing), the shorter visual rehabilitation period, and minimal postoperative\\npain. Disadvantages include possible intraoperative and postoperative flap-related complications, such as\\nirregular flap formation, flap dislocation, and the need for adequate corneal thickness to prevent long-term\\ncorneal ectasia. Ectasia occurs when the cornea has become so thin that intraocular pressure causes\\ninstability and bulging of the thinned and weakened corneal stroma. Blurring, increasing myopia, and\\nirregular astigmatism can result.\\nPhotorefractive Keratectomy\\nIn PRK, the excimer laser is used to sculpt (photoablate) the anterior curvature of the corneal stromal bed\\nto treat myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. The corneal epithelium is removed before photoablation and\\ngenerally takes 3 to 4 days to regenerate; during this time a bandage contact lens is worn. Unlike LASIK,\\nno corneal flap is created.\\nPRK may be more suitable for patients with thin corneas or anterior basement membrane dystrophy.\\nAdvantages of PRK include an overall thicker residual stromal bed (thereby reducing risk of ectasia) and\\nlack of flap-related complications. Disadvantages include potential for corneal haze formation if a large\\namount of corneal tissue is ablated and the need for postoperative corticosteroid drops for 3 to 4 mo.\\nMore than 95% of patients see 20/40 or better without eyeglasses after surgery.\\nIntracorneal Ring Segments\\nIntracorneal ring segments (INTACS) are thin arc-shaped segments of biocompatible plastic that are\\ninserted in pairs through a small radial corneal incision into the peripheral corneal stroma at two-thirds\\ndepth. After INTACS are inserted, the central corneal curvature is flattened, reducing myopia. INTACS are\\nused for mild myopia (< 3 diopters) and minimal astigmatism (< 1 diopter). INTACS maintain a central,\\nclear, optical zone because the 2 segments are placed in the corneal periphery. INTACS can be replaced\\nor removed if desired.\\nRisks include induced astigmatism, undercorrection and overcorrection, infection, glare, halo, and\\nincorrect depth placement.

CK uses radiofrequency energy applied with a fine\\nprobe in a ring pattern to the peripheral cornea to contract the periphery and steepen the center, thereby\\nincreasing the refractive power of the cornea. For presbyopic patients who wear only reading glasses, CK\\nis typically done in the nondominant eye (monovision) to induce myopia in that eye and enable the patient\\nto regain reading vision. As the presbyopia progresses, additional rings of treatment are added. Risks of\\nCK include induced astigmatism and regression of effect.\\nPhakic Intraocular Lenses\\nPhakic intraocular lenses (IOLs) are lens implants that are used to treat severe myopia in patients who\\nare not suitable candidates for laser vision correction.

It\\nmay also be due to a virus (eg, herpes simplex, varicella zoster).\\nAcute nonulcerative blepharitis is usually caused by an allergic reaction involving the same area (eg,\\natopic blepharodermatitis and seasonal allergic blepharoconjunctivitis, which cause intense itching,\\nrubbing, and a rash; contact sensitivity [dermatoblepharo-conjunctivitis]).\\nChronic:\\n Chronic blepharitis is noninfectious inflammation of unknown cause. Meibomian glands in the\\neyelid produce lipids (meibum) that reduce tear evaporation by forming a lipid layer on top of the aqueous\\ntear layer. In meibomian gland dysfunction, the lipid composition is abnormal, and gland ducts and orifices\\nbecome inspissated with hard, waxy plugs. Many patients have rosacea (see p. \\n654\\n) and recurrent\\nhordeola or chalazia.\\nMany patients with seborrheic blepharitis have seborrheic dermatitis of the face and scalp (see p. \\n671\\n) or\\nacne rosacea. Secondary bacterial colonization often occurs on the scales that develop on the eyelid\\nmargin. Meibomian glands can become obstructed.\\nMost patients with meibomian gland dysfunction or seborrheic blepharitis have increased tear evaporation\\nand secondary keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms common to all forms of blepharitis include itching and burning of the eyelid margins and\\nconjunctival irritation with lacrimation, photosensitivity, and foreign body sensation.\\nAcute:\\n In acute ulcerative blepharitis, small pustules may develop in eyelash follicles and eventually\\nbreak down to form shallow marginal ulcers. Tenacious adherent crusts leave a bleeding surface when\\nremoved. During sleep, eyelids can become glued together by dried secretions. Recurrent ulcerative\\nblepharitis can cause eyelid scars and loss of eyelashes.\\nIn acute nonulcerative blepharitis, eyelid margins become edematous and erythematous; eyelashes may\\nbecome crusted with dried serous fluid.\\nChronic:\\n In meibomian gland dysfunction, examination reveals dilated, inspissated gland orifices that,\\nwhen pressed, exude a waxy, thick, yellowish secretion with pressure.

Chronic blepharitis that does not respond to treatment may\\nrequire biopsy to exclude eyelid tumors that can simulate the condition.\\nPrognosis\\nAcute blepharitis most often responds to treatment but may recur, develop into chronic blepharitis, or\\nboth.

Acute viral ulcerative blepharitis is treated with\\nsystemic antivirals (eg, for herpes simplex, acyclovir 400 mg po tid for 7 days; for varicella zoster,\\nfamciclovir 500 mg po tid or valacyclovir 1 g po tid for 7 days).\\nTreatment of acute nonulcerative blepharitis begins with avoiding the offending action (eg, rubbing) or\\nsubstance (eg, new eye drops). Warm compresses over the closed eyelid may relieve symptoms and\\nspeed resolution. If swelling persists > 24 h, topical corticosteroids (eg, fluorometholone ophthalmic\\nointment 0.1% tid for 7 days) can be used.\\nChronic:\\n The initial treatment for both meibomian gland dysfunction and seborrheic blepharitis is directed\\ntoward the secondary keratoconjunctivitis sicca (see p. \\n592\\n). Tear supplements, bland ointments at night,\\nand, if necessary, punctal plugs (inserts that obstruct the puncta and thus decrease tear drainage) are\\neffective in most patients.\\nIf needed, additional treatment for meibomian gland dysfunction includes warm compresses to melt the\\nwaxy plugs and occasionally eyelid massage to extrude trapped secretions and coat the ocular surface. A\\ntetracycline (eg, doxycycline 100 mg po bid tapered over 3 to 4 mo) may also be effective because it\\nchanges the composition of meibomian gland secretions.\\nIf needed, additional treatment for seborrheic blepharitis includes gentle cleansing of the eyelid margin 2\\ntimes a day with a cotton swab dipped in a dilute solution of baby shampoo (2 to 3 drops in 1/2 cup of\\nwarm water). A topical antibiotic ointment (bacitracin/polymyxin B or sulfacetamide 10% bid for up to 3 mo)\\nmay be added to reduce bacterial counts on the eyelid margin when cases are unresponsive to weeks of\\neyelid hygiene.\\nBlepharospasm\\nBlepharospasm is spasm of muscles around the eye causing involuntary blinking and eye\\nclosing.\\nThe cause of blepharospasm is most often unknown. It affects women more than men and tends to occur\\nin families. Blepharospasm may be secondary to eye disorders, including those that cause ocular irritation\\n(eg, trichiasis, corneal foreign body, keratoconjunctivitis sicca) and systemic neurologic diseases that\\ncause spasm (eg, Parkinson's disease).\\nSymptoms are involuntary blinking and closing of the eyes; in severe cases, people cannot open their\\neyes.

Sunglasses help decrease\\nthe light sensitivity that may cause or accompany blepharospasm.\\nCanaliculitis\\nCanaliculitis is inflammation of the canaliculus (see\\nFig. 60-3\\n on p. \\n567\\n).\\nThe most common cause is infection with \\nActinomyces israelii\\n, a gram-positive bacillus with fine\\nbranching filaments, but other bacteria, fungi (eg, \\nCandida albicans\\n), and viruses (eg, herpes simplex)\\nmay be causative. Symptoms and signs are tearing, discharge, red eye (especially nasally), and mild\\ntenderness over the involved side.\\nDiagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and signs, expression of turbid secretions with pressure over\\nthe lacrimal sac, and a gritty sensation caused by necrotic material that can be felt during probing of the\\nlacrimal system. Canaliculitis can be differentiated from dacryocystitis. In canaliculitis, the punctum and\\ncanaliculus are red and swollen; in dacryocystitis, the punctum and canaliculus are normal, but a red,\\nswollen, tender mass is located in or near the lacrimal sac.\\nTreatment is warm compresses, irrigation of the canaliculus with antibiotic solution (by an\\nophthalmologist), and removal of any concretions, which usually requires surgery. Antibiotic selection is\\nusually empiric with a 1st-generation cephalosporin or penicillinase-resistant synthetic penicillin but may\\nbe guided by irrigation samples.\\nChalazion and Hordeolum\\nChalazia and hordeola are sudden-onset localized swellings of the eyelid. A chalazion is caused\\nby noninfectious meibomian gland occlusion, whereas a hordeolum is caused by infection. Both\\nconditions initially cause eyelid hyperemia and edema, swelling, and pain. With time, a\\nchalazion becomes a small nontender nodule in the eyelid center, whereas a \\nhordeolum\\nremains painful and localizes to an eyelid margin. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is with hot\\ncompresses. Both conditions improve spontaneously, but incision or, for chalazia, intralesional\\ncorticosteroids may be used to hasten resolution.\\nChalazion:\\n A chalazion is noninfectious obstruction of a meibomian gland causing extravasation of\\nirritating lipid material in the eyelid soft tissues with focal secondary granulomatous inflammation (see\\nPlate 7\\n). Disorders that cause abnormally thick meibomian gland secretions (eg, meibomian gland\\ndysfunction, acne rosacea) increase the risk of meibomian gland obstruction.\\nHordeolum:\\n A hordeolum (stye) is an acute, localized, pyogenic (usually staphylococcal) infection or\\nabscess of the eyelid that may be external or internal (see\\nPlate 16\\n). Most hordeola are external and result from obstruction and infection of an eyelash follicle and\\nadjacent glands of Zeis or Moll's glands. Follicle obstruction may be associated with blepharitis. An\\ninternal hordeolum, which is very rare, results from infection of a meibomian gland. Sometimes cellulitis\\naccompanies hordeola.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nChalazia and hordeola each cause eyelid redness, swelling, and pain.\\nChalazion:\\n After 1 or 2 days, a chalazion localizes to the body of the eyelid. Typically, a small nontender\\nnodule or lump develops. A chalazion usually drains through the inner surface of the eyelid or is absorbed\\nspontaneously over 2 to 8 wk; rarely, it persists longer. Vision may be slightly blurred.\\nHordeolum:\\n After 1 to 2 days, an external hordeolum localizes to the eyelid margin. There may be\\ntearing, photophobia, and a foreign body sensation. Typically, a small yellowish pustule develops at the\\nbase of an eyelash, surrounded by hyperemia, induration, and diffuse edema.

The conjunctiva helps maintain the tear film and protect the eye from foreign\\nobjects and infection.\\nThe sclera is the thick white sphere of dense connective tissue that encloses the eye and maintains its\\nshape. Anteriorly, the sclera fuses with the cornea, and posteriorly it blends with the meninges where the\\noptic nerve penetrates the globe.\\nThe episclera is a thin vascular membrane between the conjunctiva and the sclera.\\nThe most common disorders are inflammatory (eg, conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis). Conjunctivitis can\\nbe acute or chronic and is infectious, allergic, or irritant in origin. Scleritis usually results from immune-\\nmediated disease and episcleritis often does as well. Episcleritis usually does not threaten vision, but\\nscleritis can destroy vision and the eye. Major symptoms of conjunctivitides (eg, conjunctival hyperemia)\\nare similar. Early, accurate diagnosis is important.\\nSelect eye findings in conjunctival disorders:\\n Edema of the bulbar conjunctiva results in a\\ntranslucent, bluish, thickened conjunctiva. Gross edema with ballooning of the conjunctiva, often leading\\nto prolapse of conjunctiva, is known as chemosis.\\nEdema of the tarsal conjunctiva (typical of allergic conjunctivitis) results in fine, minute projections\\n(papillae), giving the conjunctiva a velvety appearance.\\nHyperplasia of lymphoid follicles in the conjunctiva can occur in viral or chlamydial conjunctivitis. It\\nappears as small bumps with pale centers, resembling cobblestones. It occurs most commonly in the\\ninferior tarsal conjunctiva.\\nCicatricial Pemphigoid\\n(Benign Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid; Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid; Ocular Cicatricial Pemphigoid)\\nCicatricial pemphigoid is a chronic, bilateral, progressive scarring and shrinkage of the\\nconjunctiva with opacification of the cornea. Early \\nsymptoms are hyperemia, discomfort,\\nitching, and discharge; progression leads to eyelid and corneal damage and sometimes\\nblindness. Diagnosis may be confirmed by biopsy, but biopsy is often not necessary. Treatment\\nmay require systemic immunosuppression.\\nCicatricial pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease in which binding of anticonjunctival basement\\nmembrane antibodies results in conjunctival inflammation. It is unrelated to bullous pemphigoid.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nUsually beginning as a chronic conjunctivitis, the condition progresses to symblepharon (adhesion\\nbetween the tarsal and bulbar conjunctiva); trichiasis (in-turning eyelashes); keratoconjunctivitis sicca;\\ncorneal neovascularization, opacification, and keratinization; and conjunctival shrinkage and\\nkeratinization.

However,\\ntemporarily missing some cases of mild bacterial conjunctivitis is not likely to be harmful because the\\ninfection often resolves spontaneously and antibiotics can be prescribed if symptoms persist.\\nTreatment\\n• Prevention of spread\\n• Treatment of symptoms\\nMost infectious conjunctivitis is highly contagious and spreads by droplet, fomites, and hand-to-eye\\ninoculation. To avoid transmitting infection, physicians must wash their hands thoroughly and disinfect\\nequipment after examining patients. Patients should wash their hands thoroughly after touching their eyes\\nor nasal secretions, avoid touching the noninfected eye after touching the infected eye, avoid sharing\\ntowels or pillows, and avoid swimming in pools. Eyes should be kept free of discharge and should not be\\npatched. Small children with conjunctivitis should be kept home from school to avoid spread. Cool wash-\\ncloths applied to the eyes may help relieve local burning and itching. Antimicrobials are used for certain\\ninfections.\\nViral Conjunctivitis\\nViral conjunctivitis is a highly contagious acute conjunctival infection usually caused by\\nadenovirus. Symptoms include irritation, photophobia, and watery discharge. Diagnosis is\\nclinical. Infection is self-limited, but severe cases sometimes require topical corticosteroids.\\nEtiology\\nConjunctivitis may accompany the common cold and other systemic viral infections (especially measles,\\nbut also chickenpox, rubella, and mumps). Isolated viral conjunctivitis usually results from adenoviruses\\nand sometimes enteroviruses.\\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis usually results from adenovirus serotypes Ad 5, 8, 11, 13, 19, and 37.\\nPharyngoconjunctival fever usually results from serotypes Ad 3, 4, and 7. Outbreaks of acute\\nhemorrhagic conjunctivitis, a rare conjunctivitis associated with infection by enterovirus type 70, have\\noccurred in Africa and Asia.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAfter an incubation period of about 5 to 12 days, conjunctival hyperemia, watery discharge, and ocular\\nirritation usually begin in one eye and spread rapidly to the other. Follicles may be present on the\\npalpebral conjunctiva. A preauricular lymph node is often enlarged and painful. Many patients have had\\ncontact with someone with conjunctivitis, a recent URI, or both.\\n[\\nTable 63-1.\\n Differentiating Features in Acute Conjunctivitis]\\nIn severe adenoviral conjunctivitis, patients may have photophobia and foreign body sensation. Chemosis\\nmay be present. Pseudomembranes of fibrin and inflammatory cells on the tarsal conjunctiva, focal\\ncorneal inflammation, or both may blur vision. Even after conjunctivitis has resolved, residual corneal\\nsubepithelial opacities (multiple, coin-shaped, 0.5 to 1.0 mm in diameter) may be visible with a slit lamp for\\nup to 2 yr. Corneal opacities occasionally result in decreased vision and significant glare.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 63. Conjunctival & Scleral Disorders\\n682\"),\n",

The causative organism is \\nChlamydia trachomatis\\n (serotypes A, B, Ba,\\nand C). In the US, trachoma is rare, occurring occasionally among Native Americans and immigrants. The\\ndisease occurs mainly in children, particularly those between the ages of 3 and 6.

Corneal Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe cornea is subject to infection, noninfectious inflammation, ulceration, mechanical damage, and\\nenvironmental injury. Infection (keratitis), frequently with secondary conjunctivitis, can be due to viruses,\\nbacteria, \\nAcanthamoeba\\n, or fungi. Ulceration usually represents progression of keratitis. Symptoms that\\nsuggest corneal involvement rather than simple conjunctivitis include pain, particularly with exposure to\\nlight, and slight impairment of vision. Evaluation of the cornea requires slit-lamp examination and\\nsometimes microbial studies.\\nBullous Keratopathy\\nBullous keratopathy is the presence of corneal epithelial bullae, resulting from corneal\\nendothelial disease.\\nBullous keratopathy is caused by edema of the cornea, resulting from failure of the corneal endothelium\\nto maintain the normally dehydrated state of the cornea. Most frequently, it is due to Fuchs' corneal\\nendothelial \\ndystrophy or corneal endothelial trauma. Fuchs' dystrophy causes bilateral, progressive\\ncorneal endothelial cell loss, sometimes leading to symptomatic bullous keratopathy by age 50 to 60.\\nCorneal endothelial trauma can occur during intraocular surgery (eg, cataract removal) or after placement\\nof a poorly designed or malpositioned intraocular lens implant, leading to bullous keratopathy. Bullous\\nkeratopathy after cataract removal is called pseudophakic (if an intraocular lens implant is present) or\\naphakic (if no intraocular lens implant is present) bullous keratopathy.\\nSubepithelial fluid-filled bullae form on the corneal surface as the corneal stroma swells, leading to eye\\ndiscomfort, decreased visual acuity, loss of contrast, glare, and photophobia. Sometimes bullae rupture,\\ncausing pain and foreign body sensation. Bacteria can invade a ruptured bulla, leading to a corneal ulcer.\\nThe bullae and swelling of the corneal stroma can be seen on slit-lamp examination.\\nTreatment requires an ophthalmologist and includes topical dehydrating agents (eg, hypertonic saline),\\nintraocular pressure-lowering agents, soft contact lenses for some mild to moderate cases, and treatment\\nof any secondary microbial infection. Corneal transplantation is usually curative.\\nCorneal Ulcer\\nA corneal ulcer is a corneal epithelial defect with underlying inflammation (which soon results in\\nnecrosis of corneal tissue) due to invasion by bacteria, fungi, viruses, or \\nAcanthamoeba\\n. It can\\nbe initiated by mechanical trauma or nutritional deficiencies. Symptoms are progressive\\nredness, foreign body sensation, ache, photophobia, and lacrimation. Diagnosis is by slit-lamp\\nexamination, fluorescein staining, and microbial studies. Treatment with topical antimicrobials\\nand often dilating drops is urgent and requires an ophthalmologist.\\nEtiology\\nCorneal ulcers have many causes (see\\nTable 64-1\\n). Bacterial ulcers (most commonly due to contact lens wear) may complicate herpes simplex\\nkeratitis and be particularly refractory to treatment. Ulcers caused by \\nAcanthamoeba\\n (also most\\ncommonly due to contact lens wear) and fungi (most commonly due to trauma with vegetable material) are\\nindolent but progressive; those caused by \\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\\n (seen almost exclusively in contact\\nlens wearers) develop rapidly, causing deep and extensive corneal necrosis. Wearing contact lenses\\nwhile sleeping or wearing inadequately disinfected contact lenses can cause corneal ulcers (see p. \\n572\\n).\\nPathophysiology\\nUlcers are characterized by corneal epithelial defects with underlying inflammation, and soon necrosis of\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 64.

Stromal involvement is probably an immunologic response to the virus.\\nAs with all herpes simplex virus infections, there is a primary infection, followed by a latent phase, in\\nwhich the virus goes into the nerve roots. Latent virus may reactivate, causing recurrent symptoms.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPrimary infection:\\n The initial (primary) infection is usually nonspecific self-limiting conjunctivitis, often in\\nearly childhood and sometimes without corneal involvement. If the cornea is involved, early symptoms\\ninclude foreign body sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, and conjunctival hyperemia. Sometimes\\nvesicular blepharitis (blisters on the eyelid) follows, symptoms worsen, vision blurs, and blisters break\\ndown and ulcerate, then resolve without scarring in about a week.\\nRecurrent infection:\\n Recurrences usually take the form of epithelial keratitis (also called dendritic\\nkeratitis) with tearing, foreign body sensation, and a characteristic branching (dendritic or serpentine)\\nlesion of the corneal epithelium with knoblike terminals that stain with fluorescein (see\\nPlate 14\\n). Multiple recurrences may result in corneal hypoesthesia or anesthesia, ulceration, and\\npermanent scarring.\\nStromal involvement:\\n Most patients with disciform keratitis, which involves the corneal stroma, have a\\nhistory of epithelial keratitis.

It may result from a damaged or malfunctioning lacrimal gland\\ndue to graft-vs-host disease, HIV (diffuse infiltrative lymphocytosis syndrome), local radiation therapy, or\\nfamilial dysautonomia.\\nEvaporative keratoconjunctivitis sicca is caused by loss of the tear film due to abnormally rapid\\nevaporation caused by an inadequate oil layer on the surface of the aqueous layer of tears. Symptoms\\nmay result from abnormal oil quality (ie, meibomian gland dysfunction) or a degraded normal oil layer (ie,\\nseborrheic blepharitis). Patients frequently have acne rosacea.\\nDrying can also result from exposure due to inadequate eye closure at night (nocturnal lagophthalmos) or,\\nrarely, from inadequate tear volume due to an insufficient blink rate.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPatients report itching; burning; a gritty, pulling, or foreign body sensation; or photophobia. A sharp\\nstabbing pain, eye strain or fatigue, and blurred vision may also occur. Some patients note a flood of\\ntears after severe irritation. Typically, symptoms fluctuate in intensity and may be intermittent.

Recurrent and prolonged blurring and frequent intense irritation can impair daily function.\\nHowever, permanent impairment of vision is rare.\\nWith both forms, the conjunctiva is hyperemic, and there is often scattered, fine, punctate loss of corneal\\nepithelium (superficial punctate keratitis), conjunctival epithelium, or both.

The Schirmer test and tear\\nbreakup test may differentiate type.\\nThe Schirmer test determines whether tear production is normal. After blotting the closed eye to remove\\nexcess tears, a strip of filter paper is placed, without topical anesthesia, at the junction of the middle and\\nlateral third of the lower eyelid. If < 5.5 mm of wetting occurs after 5 min on 2 successive occasions, the\\npatient has aqueous tear-deficient keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\\nWith evaporative keratoconjunctivitis sicca, the Schirmer test is usually normal. The tear film can be made\\nvisible under cobalt blue light at the slit lamp by instillation of a small volume of highly concentrated\\nfluorescein (made by wetting a fluorescein strip with saline and shaking the strip to remove any excess\\nmoisture). Blinking several times reapplies a complete tear film. The patient then stares, and the length of\\ntime until the first dry spot develops is determined (tear breakup test, or TBUT). An accelerated rate of\\nintact tear film breakup (< 10 sec) is characteristic of evaporative keratoconjunctivitis sicca.\\nIf aqueous tear-deficient keratoconjunctivitis sicca is diagnosed, Sjogren's syndrome (see p. \\n303\\n) should\\nbe suspected, especially if xerostomia is also present. Serologic tests and labial salivary gland biopsy are\\nused for diagnosis.

More viscous artificial tears coat the ocular\\nsurface longer, and artificial tears that contain polar lipids such as glycerin reduce evaporation; both types\\nare particularly useful in evaporative keratoconjunctivitis sicca. Artificial tear ointments applied before\\nsleep are particularly useful when patients have nocturnal lagophthalmos or irritation on waking. Most\\ncases are treated adequately throughout the patient's life with such supplementation. Staying hydrated,\\nusing humidifiers, and avoiding dry, drafty environments can often help. Not smoking and avoiding\\nsecondary smoke are important. In recalcitrant cases, occlusion of the nasolacrimal punctum may be\\nindicated. In severe cases, a partial tarsorrhaphy can reduce tear loss through evaporation.

Glaucoma\\nIntroduction\\nGlaucomas are a group of eye disorders characterized by progressive optic nerve damage at least partly\\ndue to increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Glaucoma is the 3rd most common cause of blindness\\nworldwide and the 2nd most common cause of blindness in the US, where it is the leading cause of\\nblindness for blacks and Hispanics. About 3 million Americans and 14 million people worldwide have\\nglaucoma, but only half are aware of it. Glaucoma can occur at any age but is 6 times more common\\namong people > 60 yr.\\nGlaucomas are categorized as open-angle or closed-angle (angle-closure)—see\\nTables 65-1\\n,\\n65-2\\n, and\\n65-3\\n. The \"angle\" refers to the angle formed by the junction of the iris and cornea at the periphery of the\\nanterior chamber (see\\nFig. 65-1\\n). The angle is where > 98% of the aqueous humor exits the eye via either the trabecular\\nmeshwork and Schlemm\\'s canal (the major pathway, particularly in the elderly) or the ciliary body face and\\nchoroidal vasculature. These outflow pathways are not simply a mechanical filter and drain but instead\\ninvolve active physiologic processes.\\nGlaucomas are further subdivided into primary (cause of outflow resistance or angle closure is unknown)\\nand secondary (outflow resistance results from another disorder), accounting for > 20 adult types.\\nPathophysiology\\nAxons of retinal ganglion cells travel through the optic nerve carrying images from the eye to the brain.\\nDamage to these axons causes ganglion cell death with resultant optic nerve atrophy and patchy vision\\nloss. Elevated IOP (in unaffected eyes, the average range is 11 to 21 mm Hg) plays a role in axonal\\ndamage, either by direct nerve compression or diminution of blood flow. However, the relationship\\nbetween pressure and nerve damage is variable. Of people with IOP > 21 mm Hg (ie, ocular\\nhypertension), only about 1 to 2%/yr (about 10% over 5 yr) develop glaucoma. Additionally, about one\\nthird of patients with glaucoma do not have IOPs > 21 mm Hg (known as lowtension glaucoma or normal-\\ntension glaucoma).\\nIOP is determined by the balance of aqueous secretion and drainage. Elevated IOP is caused by inhibited\\nor obstructed outflow, not oversecretion. In open-angle glaucoma, IOP is elevated because outflow is\\ninadequate despite an angle that appears unobstructed. In angle-closure glaucoma, IOP is elevated when\\na physical distortion of the peripheral iris mechanically blocks outflow.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms and signs vary with the type of glaucoma, but the defining characteristic is optic nerve damage\\nas evidenced by an abnormal optic disk (see p. \\n601\\n and\\nPlate 13\\n) and certain types of visual field deficits (see p. \\n601\\n).\\nIOP may be elevated or within the average range. (For techniques of measurement, see p.\\n540\\n)\\nDiagnosis\\n• Characteristic visual field defects\\n• Exclusion of other causes\\n• IOP usually > 21 mm Hg (but not required for the diagnosis)\\nGlaucoma should be suspected in a patient with any of the following:\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 65.

Oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are effective, but adverse effects\\nlimit their use.\\nPatients taking topical glaucoma drugs should be taught passive lid closure with punctal occlusion to help\\nreduce systemic absorption and associated adverse effects, although the effectiveness of these\\nmaneuvers is controversial. Patients who have difficulty instilling drops directly onto the conjunctiva may\\nplace the drop on the nose just medial to the medial canthus, then roll the head slightly toward the eye so\\nthat the liquid flows into the eye.\\nTypically, to gauge effectiveness, clinicians start drugs in only one eye (one-eye trial); once improvement\\nin the treated eye has been confirmed at a subsequent visit (typically 1 to 4 wk later), both eyes are\\ntreated.\\nSurgery:\\n Surgery for primary open-angle and normal-pressure glaucoma includes laser trabeculoplasty,\\na guarded filtration procedure, and possibly tube shunts or ciliodestructive procedures.\\nArgon laser trabeculoplasty\\n (ALT) may be the initial treatment for patients who do not respond to or\\nwho cannot tolerate drug therapy. Laser energy is applied to either 180° or 360° of the trabecular\\nmeshwork to improve the drainage of aqueous humor. Within 2 to 5 yr, about 50% of patients require\\nadditional drug therapy or surgery because of insufficient IOP control.\\nSelective laser trabeculoplasty\\n (SLT) uses a pulsed double-frequency neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-\\ngarnet laser. SLT and ALT are equally effective initially, but SLT may have greater effectiveness in\\nsubsequent treatments.\\nA \\nguarded filtration procedure\\n is the most commonly used filtration procedure. A hole is made in the\\nlimbal sclera (trabeculectomy), which is covered by a partial-thickness scleral flap that controls egress of\\naqueous from the eye to the subconjunctival space, forming a filtration bleb. Adverse effects of glaucoma\\nfiltration surgery include acceleration of cataract growth, pressures that are too low, and transient\\nswelling during the perioperative period. Patients with trabeculectomies are at increased risk of bacterial\\nendophthalmitis and should be instructed to report any symptoms or signs of bleb infection (blebitis) or\\nendophthalmitis immediately.\\nViscocanalostomy, canaloplasty, and Trabectome® surgery are newer filtration procedures that do not\\ninvolve creating a fistula between the anterior chamber and subconjunctival space. Viscocanalostomy and\\ncanaloplasty involve dilating Schlemm's canal. Trabectome® surgery uses a proprietary device to remove\\na portion of the inner aspect of one of the drains of the eye (trabecular meshwork).

Elevated IOP damages the optic nerve.\\nPathophysiology\\nAngle closure may be primary (cause is unknown) or secondary to another condition (see \\nTable 65-2\\n) and\\ncan be acute, subacute (intermittent), or chronic.\\n[\\nTable 65-4.\\n Drugs Used to Treat Glaucoma]\\nPrimary angle-closure glaucoma:\\n Narrow angles are not present in young people. As people age, the\\nlens of the eye continues to grow. In some but not all people, this growth pushes the iris forward,\\nnarrowing the angle. Risk factors for developing narrow angles include Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, family\\nhistory, and advanced age.\\nIn people with narrow angles, the distance between the pupillary iris and the lens is also very narrow.\\nWhen the iris dilates, forces pull it centripetally and posteriorly causing iris-lens contact, which prevents\\naqueous from passing between the lens and iris into the anterior chamber (this mechanism is termed\\npupillary block). Pressure from the continued secretion \\nof aqueous into the posterior chamber by the\\nciliary body pushes the peripheral iris anteriorly (causing a forward-bowing iris called iris bombe), closing\\nthe angle. This closure blocks aqueous outflow, resulting in rapid (within hours) and severe (> 40 mm Hg)\\nelevation of IOP. Because of the rapid onset, this condition is called primary acute angle-closure\\nglaucoma and is an ophthalmic emergency requiring immediate treatment.\\nIntermittent angle-closure glaucoma occurs if the episode of pupillary block resolves spontaneously after\\nseveral hours, usually after sleeping supine.\\nChronic angle-closure glaucoma occurs if the angle narrows slowly, allowing scarring between the\\nperipheral iris and trabecular meshwork; IOP elevation is slow.\\nPupillary dilation (mydriasis) can push the iris into the angle and precipitate acute angle-closure glaucoma\\nin any person with narrow angles. This development is of particular concern when applying topical agents\\nto dilate the eye for examination (eg, cyclopentolate, phenylephrine) or for treatment (eg, homatropine) or\\nwhen giving systemic drugs that have the potential to dilate the pupils (eg, scopolamine, \\nα\\n-adrenergic\\nagonists commonly used to treat urinary incontinence, drugs with anticholinergic effects).\\nSecondary angle-closure glaucomas:\\n The mechanical obstruction of the angle is due to a coexisting\\ncondition, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), ischemic central vein occlusion, uveitis, or\\nepithelial down-growth. Contraction of a neovascular membrane (eg, in PDR) or inflammatory scarring\\nassociated with uveitis can pull the iris into the angle.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nAcute angle-closure glaucoma:\\n Patients have severe ocular pain and redness, decreased vision,\\ncolored halos around lights, headache, nausea, and vomiting. The systemic complaints may be so severe\\nthat patients are misdiagnosed as having a neurologic or GI problem. Examination typically reveals\\nconjunctival hyperemia, a hazy cornea, a fixed mid-dilated pupil, and anterior chamber inflammation.\\nVision is decreased. IOP is usually 40 to 80 mm Hg. The optic nerve is difficult to visualize because of\\ncorneal edema, and visual field testing is not done because of discomfort.\\nChronic angle-closure glaucoma:\\n This type of glaucoma manifests similarly to open-angle glaucoma\\n(see p. \\n600\\n). Some patients have ocular redness, discomfort, blurred vision, or headache that lessens\\nwith sleep (perhaps because of sleep-induced miosis and posterior displacement of the lens by gravity).\\nOn gonioscopy, the angle is narrow, and peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) may be seen.

Symptoms include decreased vision, ocular ache, redness,\\nphotophobia, and floaters. Although intraocular inflammation is identified clinically, identifying\\nthe cause of the inflammation typically requires testing. Treatment depends on cause but\\ntypically includes topical, locally injected, or systemic corticosteroids with a topical cycloplegic-\\nmydriatic drug. Noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive drugs may be used in severe and\\nrefractory cases. Infectious causes require antimicrobial therapy.\\nInflammation of the uvea (uveitis) may occur with or without vitreitis, retinitis, papillitis, or optic neuritis.\\nUveitis is classified anatomically as anterior, intermediate, or posterior uveitis or panuveitis.\\nAnterior uveitis\\n is localized primarily to the anterior segment of the eye and includes iritis (inflammation\\nin the anterior chamber alone) and iridocyclitis (inflammation in the anterior chamber and anterior\\nvitreous).\\nIntermediate uveitis\\n (peripheral uveitis or chronic cyclitis) occurs in the vitreous.\\nPosterior uveitis\\n refers to any form of retinitis, choroiditis, or inflammation of the optic disk.\\nPanuveitis\\n (also called diffuse uveitis) implies inflammation in both the anterior and posterior chambers.\\nEtiology\\nMost cases are idiopathic and presumed to be autoimmune in origin. Identifiable causes include\\n• Trauma\\n• Ocular and systemic infections\\n• Systemic autoimmune disorders\\nThe most common cause of anterior uveitis is trauma (traumatic iridocyclitis). Other causes are\\nspondyloarthropathies (20 to 25%), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and herpesvirus (herpes simplex and\\nvaricella-zoster) infection. Half of all cases of anterior uveitis are idiopathic.\\nMost intermediate uveitis is idiopathic. Uncommon identifiable causes include multiple sclerosis,\\nsarcoidosis, TB, syphilis, and, in endemic regions, Lyme disease.\\nMost posterior uveitis (retinitis) is idiopathic. The most commonly recognized cause of posterior uveitis in\\nimmunocompetent patients is toxoplasmosis; the most commonly recognized cause in patients with\\nHIV/AIDS is cytomegalovirus (CMV).\\nThe most commonly identified cause of panuveitis is sarcoidosis, but most cases remain idiopathic\\ndespite appropriate testing.\\nInfrequently, systemic drugs cause uveitis (usually anterior).

Unlike most\\nforms of anterior uveitis, however, JIA tends not to cause pain, photophobia, and conjunctival injection but\\nonly blurring and meiosis and is, therefore, often referred to as white iritis. JIA-associated uveitis is more\\ncommon among girls.\\nRecurrent bouts of inflammation are best treated with a topical corticosteroid and a cycloplegic-mydriatic\\ndrug. Long-term control often requires use of a noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive drug (eg,\\nmethotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil).\\nSarcoidosis:\\n Sarcoidosis (see also p. \\n1965\\n) accounts for 10 to 20% of cases of uveitis, and about 25%\\nof patients with sarcoidosis develop uveitis. Sarcoid uveitis is more common among blacks and the\\nelderly.\\nVirtually any symptoms and signs of anterior, intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis can occur. Suggestive\\nfindings include conjunctival granulomas, large keratic precipitates on the corneal endothelium (so-called\\ngranulomatous or mutton fat precipitates), iris granulomas, and retinal vasculitis. Biopsy of suggestive\\nlesions, which provides the most secure diagnosis, is usually done on the conjunctiva; it is rarely done on\\nintraocular tissues because of the risk associated with the procedure.\\nTreatment usually involves topical, periocular, intraocular, or systemic corticosteroids, or a combination,\\nalong with a topical cycloplegic-mydriatic drug. Patients with moderate to severe inflammation may require\\na noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive drug (eg, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine).\\nBehcet's syndrome:\\n This condition is rare in North America but is a fairly common cause of uveitis in\\nthe Middle East and Far East (see also p. \\n315\\n).\\nTypical findings include severe anterior uveitis with hypopyon, retinal vasculitis, and optic disk\\ninflammation. The clinical course is usually severe with multiple recurrences.\\nDiagnosis requires the presence of associated systemic manifestations, such as oral aphthous or genital\\nulcers; dermatitis, including erythema nodosum; thrombophlebitis; or epididymitis. Oral aphthae may be\\nbiopsied to show an occlusive vasculitis. There are no laboratory tests for Behcet's syndrome.\\nTreatment with local and systemic corticosteroids and a cycloplegic-mydriatic drug may alleviate acute\\nexacerbations, but most patients eventually require systemic corticosteroids and a noncorticosteroid\\nimmunosuppressive drug (eg, cyclosporine, chlorambucil) to control the inflammation and avoid the\\nserious complications of long-term corticosteroid treatment.

Rarely, untreated intraocular infections extend beyond the confines of the eye to\\ninvolve the orbit and CNS.\\nExogenous endophthalmitis typically causes severe ocular ache and decreased vision. Signs include\\nintense conjunctival hyperemia and intraocular inflammation within the anterior chamber and vitreous,\\noccasionally with eyelid edema.\\nDiagnosis requires a high index of suspicion in at-risk patients, especially those with recent eye surgery\\nor trauma. Gram stain and culture of aspirates from the anterior chamber and vitreous are standard.\\nPatients with suspected endogenous endophthalmitis should also have blood and urine cultures.\\nInitial treatment includes broad-spectrum intravitreal antibiotics, most commonly vancomycin and\\nceftazidime. Patients with endogenous endophthalmitis should receive both intravitreal and IV antibiotics.\\nTherapy is modified based on culture and sensitivity results.\\nVision prognosis is often poor, even with early and appropriate treatment.

Optic Nerve Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe optic pathway includes the retina, optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic radiations, and occipital cortex (see\\nFig. 69-1\\n). Damage along the optic pathway causes a variety of visual field changes (see\\nTable 60-1\\n on p. \\n540\\n).\\nHereditary Optic Neuropathies\\nHereditary optic neuropathies are genetic defects that cause vision loss, occasionally with\\ncardiac or neurologic abnormalities. There is no effective treatment.\\nHereditary optic neuropathies typically manifest in childhood or adolescence with\\n[\\nFig. 69-1.\\n Higher visual pathways—lesion sites and corresponding visual field defects.]\\nbilateral, symmetric central vision loss. Optic nerve damage is usually permanent and in some cases\\nprogressive. By the time optic atrophy is detected, substantial optic nerve injury has already occurred.\\nDominant optic atrophy:\\n This disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It is believed to be\\nthe most common of the hereditary optic neuropathies, with prevalence in the range of 1:10,000 to\\n1:50,000. It is thought to be optic abiotrophy, premature degeneration of the optic nerve leading to\\nprogressive vision loss. Onset is in the 1st decade of life.\\nLeber's hereditary optic neuropathy:\\n This disorder involves a mitochondrial DNA abnormality that\\naffects cellular respiration. Although mitochondrial DNA throughout the body is affected, vision loss is the\\nprimary manifestation. Most cases (80 to 90%) occur in males. The disease is inherited with a maternal\\ninheritance pattern, meaning that all offspring of a woman with the abnormality inherit the abnormality, but\\nonly females can pass on the abnormality because the zygote receives mitochondria only from the\\nmother.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nDominant optic atrophy:\\n Most patients have no associated neurologic abnormalities, although\\nnystagmus and hearing loss have been reported. The only symptom is slowly progressive bilateral vision\\nloss, usually mild until late in life. The entire optic disk or, at times, only the temporal part is pale without\\nvisible vessels. A blue-yellow color vision deficit is characteristic.\\nLeber's hereditary optic neuropathy:\\n Vision loss typically begins between 15 and 35 yr (range, 1 to 80\\nyr). Painless central vision loss \\nin one eye is usually followed weeks to months later by loss in the other\\neye. Simultaneous vision loss has been reported. Most patients lose vision to worse than 20/200 acuity.\\nOphthalmoscopic examination may show telangiectatic microangiopathy, swelling of the nerve fiber layer\\naround the optic disk, and an absence of leakage on fluorescein angiography. Eventually, optic atrophy\\nsupervenes.\\nSome patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy have cardiac conduction defects. Other patients\\nhave minor neurologic abnormalities, such as a postural tremor, loss of ankle reflexes, dystonia,\\nspasticity, or a multiple sclerosis-like illness.\\nDiagnosis\\nMolecular genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis of dominant optic atrophy.\\nDiagnosis of Leber's hereditary optic atrophy is mainly clinical.

The only constant symptom is painless\\nvision loss. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment is ineffective.\\nTwo varieties of optic nerve infarction exist: nonarteritic and arteritic. The nonarteritic variant occurs more\\nfrequently, typically affecting people about 50 yr and older. Vision loss tends not to be as severe as in the\\narteritic variant, which typically affects an older group, typically about 70 yr and older.\\nMost ischemic optic neuropathy is unilateral. Bilateral, sequential cases occur in about 20%, but bilateral\\nsimultaneous involvement is uncommon. Atherosclerotic narrowing of the posterior ciliary arteries may\\npredispose to nonarteritic optic nerve infarction, particularly after a hypotensive episode. Any of the\\ninflammatory arteritides, especially giant cell arteritis (see p. \\n319\\n), can precipitate the arteritic form.\\nAcute ischemia causes nerve edema, which further worsens ischemia. A small optic cup to optic disk ratio\\nis a risk factor for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy but not for the arteritic variety. Usually, no\\nmedical condition is apparent to cause the nonarteritic variety, although diabetes and hypertension are\\npresent in some patients and are thought to be risk factors. Vision loss on awakening leads investigators\\nto suspect nocturnal hypotension as a potential cause of the nonarteritic variety.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVision loss with both varieties is typically rapid (over minutes, hours, or days) and painless. Some patients\\nnotice the loss on awakening. Symptoms such as general malaise, muscle aches and pains, headaches\\nover the temple, pain when combing hair, jaw claudication, and tenderness over the temporal artery may\\nbe present with temporal arteritis; however, such symptoms may not occur until after vision is lost. Visual\\nacuity is reduced, and an afferent pupillary defect is present. The optic disk is swollen with surrounding\\nhemorrhages.

If temporal arteritis is suspected, temporal artery biopsy should be\\ndone.

Other causes include the following:\\n• Infectious diseases (eg, viral encephalitis [particularly in children], sinusitis, meningitis, TB, syphilis, HIV)\\n• Tumor metastasis to the optic nerve\\n• Chemicals and drugs (eg, lead, methanol, quinine, arsenic, antibiotics)\\nRare causes include diabetes, pernicious anemia, Graves' disease, bee stings, and trauma. Often, the\\ncause remains obscure despite thorough evaluation.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe main symptom is vision loss, frequently maximal within 1 or 2 days and varying from a small central or\\nparacentral scotoma to complete blindness. Most patients have mild eye pain, which often feels worse\\nwith eye movement.\\nIf the optic disk is swollen, the condition is called papillitis. Otherwise, it is called retrobulbar neuritis. The\\nmost characteristic findings include reduced visual acuity, a visual field deficit, and disturbed color vision\\n(often out of proportion to loss of visual acuity). An afferent pupillary defect is usually detectable if the\\ncontralateral eye is unaffected or involved to a lesser degree. Testing of color vision is a useful adjunct. In\\nabout two thirds of patients, inflammation is entirely retrobulbar, causing no visible changes in the optic\\nfundus. In the rest, disk hyperemia, edema in or around the disk, vessel engorgement, or a combination is\\npresent. A few exudates and hemorrhages may be present near or on the optic disk.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• MRI\\nOptic neuritis is suspected in patients with characteristic pain and vision loss.

Most episodes resolve spontaneously, with return of\\nvision in 2 to 3 mo. Most patients with a typical history of optic neuritis and no underlying systemic\\ndisease, such as a connective tissue disease, recover vision, but > 25% have a recurrence in the same\\neye or in the other eye. MRI is used to determine future risk of demyelinating disease.\\nTreatment\\n• Corticosteroids\\nCorticosteroids are an option, especially if multiple sclerosis is suspected. Treatment with\\nmethylprednisolone (500 mg to 1000 mg IV once/day) for 3 days followed by prednisone (1 mg/kg po\\nonce/day) for 11 days may speed recovery, but ultimate vision results are no different from those with\\nobservation alone. IV corticosteroids have been reported to delay onset of multiple sclerosis for at least 2\\nyr. Treatment with oral prednisone alone does not improve vision outcome and may increase the rate of\\nrecurrent episodes. Low-vision aids (eg, magnifiers, large-print devices, talking watches) may be helpful.\\nPapilledema\\nPapilledema is swelling of the optic disk due to increased intracranial pressure. All other causes\\nof optic disk swelling, such as that \\ncaused by malignant hypertension or thrombosis of the\\ncentral retinal vein, do not involve increased intracranial pressure and therefore are not causes\\nof papilledema. There are no early symptoms, although vision may be disturbed for a few\\nseconds. Papilledema requires an immediate search for the cause. Diagnosis is by\\nophthalmoscopy with further tests, usually brain imaging, to determine cause. Treatment is\\ndirected at the underlying condition.\\nPapilledema is a sign of elevated intracranial pressure and is almost always bilateral. Causes include the\\nfollowing:\\n• Brain tumor or abscess\\n• Cerebral trauma or hemorrhage\\n• Meningitis\\n• Arachnoidal adhesions\\n• Cavernous or dural sinus thrombosis\\n• Encephalitis\\n• Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a condition with elevated CSF pressure and\\nno mass lesion\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVision is usually not affected initially, but seconds-long graying out of vision, flickering, or blurred or\\ndouble vision may occur. Patients may have symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, such as\\nheadache or nausea and vomiting.\\nOphthalmoscopic examination reveals engorged and tortuous retinal veins, a hyperemic and swollen optic\\ndisk (optic nerve head), and retinal hemorrhages around the disk but not into the retinal periphery (see\\nPlate 19\\n).

Orbital Diseases\\nIntroduction\\nOrbital diseases may be vascular, thyroid-related (Graves' disease), infectious, inflammatory, or\\nneoplastic. Cavernous sinus thrombosis causes many of the same symptoms and signs as orbital\\ndiseases. Infiltrative ophthalmopathy due to Graves' disease, the most frequent cause of orbital disease,\\nis discussed on p. \\n780\\n. Orbital fractures are discussed on p. \\n3232\\n. (See\\nFig. 60-1\\n on p. \\n537\\n for anatomy of the orbit.)\\nCavernous Sinus Thrombosis\\nCavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a very rare, typically septic thrombosis of the cavernous\\nsinus, usually caused by bacterial sinusitis. Symptoms and signs include pain, proptosis,\\nophthalmoplegia, vision loss, papilledema, and fever. Diagnosis is confirmed by CT or MRI.\\nTreatment is with IV antibiotics. Complications are common, and prognosis is poor.\\nEtiology\\nThe cavernous sinuses are trabeculated sinuses located at the base of the skull that drain venous blood\\nfrom facial veins. CST is an extremely rare complication of common facial infections, most notably nasal\\nfuruncles (50%), sphenoidal or ethmoidal sinusitis (30%), and dental infections (10%). Most common\\npathogens are \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n (70%), followed by \\nStreptococcus\\n sp; anaerobes are more\\ncommon when the underlying condition is dental or sinus infection.\\nThrombosis of the lateral sinus (related to mastoiditis) and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus\\n(related to bacterial meningitis) occur but are rarer than CST.\\nPathophysiology\\nThe 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves and the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the 5th cranial nerve\\nare adjacent to the cavernous sinus and are commonly affected. Complications include\\nmeningoencephalitis, brain abscess, stroke, blindness, and pituitary insufficiency.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nInitial symptoms are progressively severe headache or facial pain, usually unilateral and localized to retro-\\norbital and frontal regions. High fever is common. Later, ophthalmoplegia (initially the 6th cranial nerve,\\nlateral gaze), proptosis, and lid edema develop and often become bilateral. Facial sensation may be\\ndiminished or absent. Decreased level of consciousness, confusion, seizures, and focal neurologic\\ndeficits are signs of CNS spread. Patients may also have anisocoria or mydriasis (3rd cranial nerve\\ndysfunction), papilledema, and vision loss.\\nDiagnosis\\n• MRI or CT\\nCST is often misdiagnosed because it is rare. It should be considered in patients who have signs\\nconsistent with orbital cellulitis. Features that distinguish CST from orbital cellulitis include cranial nerve\\ndysfunction, bilateral eye involvement, and mental status changes.\\nDiagnosis is based on neuroimaging. MRI is the better study, but CT is also helpful. Useful adjunct testing\\nmay include blood cultures and lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture may show inflammatory cells (PMNs,\\nlymphocytes, monocytes); other possible abnormalities include low glucose, high protein, and positive\\nCSF cultures.

Infection in children < 9 yr is typically\\nwith a single aerobic organism; patients > 15 yr typically have polymicrobial mixed aerobic and anaerobic\\n(\\nBacteroides\\n, \\nPeptostreptococcus\\n) infections.\\nPathophysiology\\nBecause orbital cellulitis originates from large adjacent foci of fulminant infection (eg, sinusitis) separated\\nby only a thin bone barrier, orbital infection can be extensive and severe.

Lesions of psoriasis and granuloma annulare commonly\\nform plaques.\\nNodules\\n are firm papules or lesions that extend into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Examples\\ninclude cysts, lipomas, and fibromas.\\nVesicles\\n are small, clear, fluid-filled blisters < 10 mm in diameter. Vesicles are characteristic of herpes\\ninfections, acute allergic contact dermatitis, and some autoimmune blistering disorders (eg, dermatitis\\nherpetiformis).\\nBullae\\n are clear fluid-filled blisters > 10 mm in diameter. These may be caused by burns, bites, irritant or\\nallergic contact dermatitis, and drug reactions. Classic autoimmune bullous diseases include pemphigus\\nvulgaris and bullous pemphigoid. Bullae also may occur in inherited disorders of skin fragility.\\nPustules\\n are vesicles that contain pus. Pustules are common in bacterial infections and folliculitis and\\nmay arise in some inflammatory disorders including pustular psoriasis.\\nUrticaria\\n (wheals or hives—see\\nPlate 53\\n) is characterized by elevated lesions caused by localized edema. Wheals are a common\\nmanifestation of hypersensitivity to drugs, stings or bites, autoimmunity, and, less commonly, physical\\nstimuli including temperature, pressure, and sunlight. The typical wheal lasts < 24 h.\\nScales\\n are heaped-up accumulations of horny epithelium that occur in disorders such as psoriasis,\\nseborrheic dermatitis, and fungal infections. Pityriasis rosea and chronic dermatitis of any type may be\\nscaly.\\nCrusts (scabs)\\n consist of dried serum, blood, or pus. Crusting can occur in inflammatory or infectious\\nskin diseases (eg, impetigo).\\nErosions\\n are open areas of skin that result from loss of part or all of the epidermis. Erosions can be\\ntraumatic or can occur with various inflammatory or infectious skin diseases. An excoriation is a linear\\nerosion caused by scratching, rubbing, or picking.\\nUlcers\\n result from loss of the epidermis and at least part of the dermis. Causes include venous stasis\\ndermatitis, physical trauma with or without vascular compromise (eg, from decubitus ulcers, peripheral\\narterial disease), infections, and vasculitis.\\nPetechiae\\n are nonblanchable punctate foci of hemorrhage. Causes include platelet abnormalities (eg,\\nthrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction), vasculitis, and infections (eg, meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain\\nspotted fever, other rickettsioses).\\nPurpura\\n is a larger area of hemorrhage that may be palpable. Palpable purpura is considered the\\nhallmark of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Purpura may indicate a coagulopathy. Large areas of purpura may\\nbe called ecchymoses or, colloquially, bruises.\\nAtrophy\\n is thinning of the skin, which may appear dry and wrinkled, resembling cigarette paper. Atrophy\\nmay be caused by chronic sun exposure, aging, and some inflammatory and neoplastic skin diseases,\\nincluding cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and lupus erythematosus. Atrophy also may result from long-term\\nuse of potent topical corticosteroids.\\nScars\\n are areas of fibrosis that replace normal skin after injury. Some scars become hypertrophic or\\nthickened and raised. Keloids are hypertrophic scars that extend beyond the original wound margin.\\nTelangiectases\\n are foci of small, permanently dilated blood vessels that are most often idiopathic but\\nmay occur in rosacea, systemic diseases (especially systemic sclerosis), or inherited diseases (eg,\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 71.

One procedure is a punch \\nbiopsy, in\\nwhich a tubular punch (diameter usually 4 mm) is inserted into deep dermal or subcutaneous tissue to\\nobtain a specimen, which is snipped off at its base. More superficial lesions may be biopsied by shaving\\nwith a scalpel or razor blade. Bleeding is controlled by aluminum chloride solution or electrodesiccation;\\nlarge incisions are closed by sutures. Larger or deeper biopsies can be done by excising a wedge of skin\\nwith a scalpel. All pigmented lesions should be excised deeply for histologic evaluation of depth;\\nsuperficial biopsies are often inadequate. Diagnosis and cure are achieved simultaneously for most small\\ntumors by complete excision that includes a small border of normal skin.\\nScrapings:\\n Skin scrapings help diagnose fungal infections and scabies. For fungal infection, scales are\\ntaken from the border of the lesion and placed onto a microscope slide. Then a drop of 10 to 20%\\npotassium hydroxide (KOH) is added. Hyphae, budding yeast, or both confirm the diagnosis of tinea or\\ncandidiasis. For scabies, scrapings are taken from suspected burrows and placed directly under a\\ncoverslip with mineral oil; findings of mites, feces, or eggs confirm the diagnosis.\\nWood's light:\\n Wood's light (black light) can help distinguish hypopigmentation from depigmentation\\n(depigmentation of vitiligo fluoresces ivory-white and hypopigmented lesions do not). Erythrasma\\nfluoresces bright orangered. Tinea capitis caused by \\nMicrosporum canis\\n and \\nMicrosporum audouinii\\nfluoresces a light, bright green. (NOTE: Most tinea capitis in the US is caused by \\nTrichophyton\\n species,\\nwhich do not fluoresce.) The earliest clue to cutaneous \\nPseudomonas\\n infection (eg, in burns) may be\\ngreen fluorescence.\\nTzanck testing:\\n Tzanck testing can be used to diagnose viral disease, such as herpes simplex and\\nherpes zoster, and is done when active intact vesicles are present. Tzanck testing cannot distinguish\\nbetween herpes simplex and herpes zoster infections. An intact blister is the preferred lesion for\\nexamination. The blister roof is removed with a sharp blade, and the base of the unroofed vesicle is\\nscraped with a #15 scalpel blade. The scrapings are transferred to a slide and stained with Wright's stain\\nor Giemsa stain. Multinucleated giant cells are a sign of herpes infection.\\nDiascopy:\\n Diascopy is used to determine whether a lesion is vascular (inflammatory) or nonvascular\\n(nevus) or hemorrhagic (petechia or purpura). A microscope slide is pressed against a lesion to see\\nwhether it blanches. Hemorrhagic lesions and nonvascular lesions do not blanch; inflammatory lesions\\ndo. Diascopy is sometimes used to identify sarcoid skin lesions, which, when tested, turn an apple jelly\\ncolor.\\nItching\\n(Pruritus)\\nItching is a symptom that can cause significant discomfort and is one of the most common reasons for\\nconsultation with a dermatologist. Itching leads to scratching, which can cause inflammation, skin\\ndegradation, and possible secondary infection. The skin can become lichenified, scaly, and excoriated.\\nPathophysiology\\nItch can be prompted by diverse stimuli, including light touch, vibration, and wool fibers. There are a\\nnumber of chemical mediators as well as different mechanisms by which the sensation of itch occurs.\\nMediators:\\n Histamine is one of the most significant mediators. It is synthesized and stored in mast cells\\nin the skin and is released in response to various stimuli. Other mediators (eg, neuropeptides) can either\\ncause the release of histamine or act as pruritogens themselves, thus explaining why antihistamines\\nameliorate some cases of itching and not others.

Localized itching (often with rash) that occurs in the area of contact with a substance is likely\\ncaused by that substance.

Avoidance of contact irritants (eg,\\nwool clothing) also may be helpful.\\nTopical drugs:\\n Topical drugs may help localized itching.

Antihistamines, most notably hydroxyzine, are effective, especially for nocturnal itch, and are most\\ncommonly used. Sedating antihistamines must be used cautiously in elderly patients during the day\\nbecause they can lead to falls; newer nonsedating antihistamines such as loratadine, fexofenadine, and\\ncetirizine can be useful for daytime itching.

The next most common cause is an autoimmune disorder. The\\ncausative autoimmune disorder is sometimes clinically apparent. Urticarial vasculitis sometimes is\\nassociated with connective tissue disorders (particularly SLE or Sjogren\\'s syndrome). In urticarial\\nvasculitis, urticaria is accompanied by findings of cutaneous vasculitis; it should be considered when the\\nurticaria are painful rather than pruritic, last > 48 h, do not blanch, or are accompanied by vesicles or\\npurpura.\\nTesting:\\n Usually, no testing is needed for an isolated episode of urticaria unless symptoms and signs\\nsuggest a specific disorder (eg, infection).\\nUnusual, recurrent, or persistent cases warrant further evaluation. Referral for allergy skin testing should\\nbe done, and routine laboratory tests should consist of CBC, blood chemistries, liver function tests, and\\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Further testing should be guided by symptoms and signs (eg, of\\nautoimmune disorders) and any abnormalities on the screening tests (eg, hepatitis serologies and\\nultrasonography for abnormal liver function tests; ova and parasites for eosinophilia; cryoglobulin titer for\\nelevated liver function tests or elevated creatinine; thyroid autoantibodies for abnormal TSH).\\nSkin biopsy should be done if there is any uncertainty as to the diagnosis or if wheals persist > 48 h (to\\nrule out urticarial vasculitis).\\nClinicians should not recommend the patient do an empiric challenge (eg, \"Try such and such again and\\nsee whether you get a reaction\") because subsequent reactions may be more severe.\\nTreatment\\nAny identified causes are treated or remedied. Implicated drugs or foods should be stopped.\\nNonspecific symptomatic treatment (eg, taking cool baths, avoiding hot water and scratching, and wearing\\nloose clothing) may be helpful.\\nDrugs:\\n Antihistamines remain the mainstay of treatment. They must be taken on a regular basis, rather\\nthan as needed. Newer oral antihistamines often are preferred because of once-daily dosing and\\nbecause some are less sedating.

Acne and Related Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nAcne vulgaris is a common skin problem, affecting most adolescents and many adults. Perioral dermatitis\\nand rosacea can produce similar lesions.\\nAcne Vulgaris\\nAcne vulgaris (acne) is the formation of comedones, papules, pustules, nodules, and/or cysts as\\na result of obstruction and inflammation of pilosebaceous units (hair follicles and their\\naccompanying sebaceous gland). It most often affects adolescents. Diagnosis is by\\nexamination. Treatment is a variety of topical and systemic agents intended to reduce sebum\\nproduction, infection, and inflammation and to normalize keratinization.\\nPathophysiology\\nAcne occurs when pilosebaceous units become obstructed with plugs of sebum and desquamated\\nkeratinocytes, then colonized and sometimes infected with the normal skin anaerobe \\nPropionibacterium\\nacnes\\n. Manifestations differ depending on whether \\nP. acnes\\n stimulates inflammation in the follicle; acne\\ncan be noninflammatory or inflammatory.\\nComedones, uninfected sebaceous plugs impacted within follicles, are the signature of noninflammatory\\nacne. Comedones are termed open or closed depending on whether the follicle is dilated or closed at the\\nskin surface. Inflammatory acne comprises papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.\\nPapules appear when lipases from \\nP. acnes\\n metabolize triglycerides into free fatty acids (FFA), which\\nirritate the follicular wall. Pustules occur when active \\nP. acnes\\n infection causes inflammation within the\\nfollicle. Nodules and cysts occur when rupture of follicles due to inflammation, physical manipulation, or\\nharsh scrubbing releases FFAs, bacteria, and keratin into tissues, triggering soft-tissue inflammation.\\nEtiology\\nThe most common trigger is puberty, when surges in androgen stimulate sebum production and\\nhyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Other triggers include hormonal changes that occur with pregnancy or\\nthroughout the menstrual cycle; occlusive cosmetics, cleansing agents, and clothing; and humidity and\\nsweating. Associations between acne exacerbation and diet (eg, chocolate), inadequate face washing,\\nmasturbation, and sex are unfounded. Some studies question an association with milk products. Acne\\nmay improve in summer months because of sunlight's anti-inflammatory effects. \\nProposed associations\\nbetween acne and hyperinsulinism require further investigation.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCystic acne can be painful; other types cause no physical symptoms but can be a source of significant\\nemotional distress. Lesion types frequently coexist at different stages.\\nComedones appear as whiteheads or blackheads. Whiteheads (closed comedones) are flesh-colored or\\nwhitish palpable lesions 1 to 3 mm in diameter; blackheads (open comedones) are similar in appearance\\nbut with a dark center.\\nPapules and pustules are red lesions 2 to 5 mm in diameter. In both, the follicular epithelium becomes\\ndamaged with accumulation of neutrophils and then lymphocytes. When the epithelium ruptures, the\\ncomedo contents elicit an intense inflammatory reaction in the dermis. Relatively deep inflammation\\nproduces papules. Pustules are more superficial.\\nNodules are larger, deeper, and more solid than papules. Such lesions resemble inflamed epidermoid\\ncysts, although they lack true cystic structure.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 73. Acne & Related Disorders\\n760\"),\n",

Many adults occasionally develop mild, isolated acne lesions. Noninflammatory and mild\\ninflammatory acne usually heals without scars. Moderate to severe inflammatory acne heals but often\\nleaves scarring.

Affected areas should be cleansed daily, but extra washing, use of antibacterial soaps, and\\nscrubbing confer no added benefit. Changes in diet are also unnecessary and ineffective, although\\nmoderation of milk intake might be considered for treatment-resistant adolescent acne. Peeling agents\\nsuch as sulfur, salicylic acid, and resorcinol are minor therapeutic adjuncts.\\nTreatment should involve educating the patient and tailoring the plan to one that is realistic for the patient.\\nTreatment failure can frequently be attributed to lack of adherence to the plan and also to lack of follow-\\nup. Consultation with a specialist may be necessary.\\nMild acne:\\n Single-agent therapy is generally sufficient for comedonal acne; papulopustular acne\\ngenerally requires dual therapy (eg, the combination of tretinoin with benzoyl peroxide or topical\\nantibiotics). Treatment should be continued for 6 wk or until lesions respond. Maintenance treatment may\\nbe necessary to maintain control.\\nA mainstay of treatment for comedones is daily topical tretinoin as tolerated. Daily adapalene gel,\\ntazarotene cream or gel, azelaic acid cream, and glycolic or salicylic acid in propylene glycol are\\nalternatives for patients who cannot tolerate topical tretinoin. Adverse effects include erythema, burning,\\nstinging, and peeling. Adapalene and tazarotene are retinoids; like tretinoin, they tend to be somewhat\\nirritating and photosensitizing. Azelaic acid has comedolytic and antibacterial properties by an unrelated\\nmechanism and may be synergistic with retinoids.\\nMild inflammatory acne should be treated with topical benzoyl peroxide, topical antibiotics (eg,\\nerythromycin, clindamycin), glyolic acid, or a combination. Combination preparations of these agents may\\nhelp limit development of resistance. None have significant adverse effects other than drying and irritation\\n(and rare allergic reactions to benzoyl peroxide). Topical retinoids are often used concomitantly.\\nPhysical extraction of comedones using a comedo extractor is an option for patients unresponsive to\\ntopical treatment. Comedo extraction may be done by a physician, nurse, or physician assistant. One end\\nof the comedo extractor is like a blade or bayonet that punctures the closed comedo. The other end\\nexerts pressure to extract the comedo.\\nOral antibiotics (eg, tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, erythromycin) can be used when wide\\ndistribution of lesions makes topical therapy impractical.\\nModerate acne:\\n Moderate acne responds best to oral systemic therapy with antibiotics. Antibiotics\\neffective for acne include tetracycline, minocycline, erythromycin, and doxycycline. Full benefit takes ≥ 12\\nwk. Topical therapy as for mild acne is usually used concomitantly with oral antibiotics.\\nTetracycline is usually a good first choice: 250 or 500 mg bid (between meals and at bedtime) for 4 wk or\\nuntil lesions respond, after which it may be reduced to the lowest effective dose. Rarely, dosage must be\\nincreased to\\n[\\nTable 73-2.\\n Drugs Used to Treat Acne]\\n500 mg qid. After control is achieved, it is reasonable to attempt to taper and discontinue the oral\\nantibiotic and continue topical therapy for control. Because relapse often follows short-term treatment,\\ntherapy may need to be continued for months to years, although for maintenance tetracycline 250 or 500\\nmg once/day is often sufficient. Minocycline 50 or 100 mg bid causes fewer GI adverse effects, is easier\\nto take, and is less likely to cause photosensitization, but it is the most costly option. Erythromycin and\\ndoxycycline are considered 2nd-line drugs because both can cause GI adverse effects, and doxycycline\\nis a frequent photosensitizer. Subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline have also been proven effective for\\nacne and rosacea.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 73. Acne & Related Disorders\\n762'),\n",

Ampicillin is an alternative treatment for gram-negative\\nfolliculitis. In women, prolonged antibiotic use can cause candidal vaginitis; if local and systemic therapy\\ndoes not eradicate this problem, antibiotic therapy for acne must be stopped.\\nSevere acne:\\n Oral isotretinoin is the best treatment for patients with moderate acne in whom antibiotics\\nare unsuccessful and for those with severe inflammatory acne. Dosage of isotretinoin is usually 1 mg/kg\\nonce/day for 16 to 20 wk, but the dosage may be increased to 2 mg/kg once/day. If adverse effects make\\nthis dosage intolerable, it may be reduced to 0.5 mg/kg once/day. After therapy, acne may continue to\\nimprove. Most patients do not require a 2nd course of treatment; when needed, it should be resumed only\\nafter the drug has been stopped for 4 mo. Retreatment is required more often if the initial dosage is low\\n(0.5 mg/kg). With this dosage (which is very popular in Europe), fewer adverse effects occur, but\\nprolonged therapy is usually required.\\nIsotretinoin is nearly always effective, but use is limited by adverse effects, including dryness of\\nconjunctivae and mucosae of the genitals, chapped lips, arthralgias, depression, elevated lipid levels, and\\nthe risk of birth defects if treatment occurs during pregnancy. Hydration with water followed by petrolatum\\napplication usually alleviates mucosal and cutaneous dryness. Arthralgias (mostly of large joints or the\\nlower back) occur in about 15% of patients.

CBC; liver function; and fasting glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels should be\\ndetermined before treatment. Each should be reassessed at 4 wk and, unless abnormalities are noted,\\nneed not be repeated until the end of treatment. Triglycerides rarely increase to a level at which the drug\\nshould be stopped. Liver function is seldom affected. Because isotretinoin is teratogenic, women of\\nchildbearing age are urged to use 2 methods of contraception for 1 mo before treatment, during\\ntreatment, and for at least 1 mo after stopping treatment. Pregnancy tests should be done before\\nbeginning therapy and monthly until 1 mo after therapy stops.\\nIntralesional injection of 0.1 mL triamcinolone acetonide suspension 2.5 mg/mL (the 10 mg/mL\\nsuspension must be diluted) is indicated for patients with firm (cystic) acne who seek quick clinical\\nimprovement and to reduce scarring. Local atrophy may occur but is usually transient. For isolated, very\\nboggy lesions, incision and drainage are often beneficial but may result in residual scarring.\\nOther forms of acne:\\n Pyoderma faciale is treated with oral corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Acne\\nfulminans is treated with oral corticosteroids and systemic antibiotics. Acne conglobata is treated with oral\\nisotretinoin if systemic antibiotics fail. For acne with endocrine abnormalities, antiandrogens are indicated.\\nSpironolactone, which has some antiandrogen effects, is sometimes prescribed to treat acne at a dose of\\n50 to 100 mg po once/day. Cyproterone acetate is used in Europe. When other measures fail, an\\nestrogen-progesterone-containing contraceptive may be tried; therapy ≥ 6 mo is needed to evaluate\\neffect.\\nScarring:\\n Small scars can be treated with chemical peels, laser resurfacing, or dermabrasion. Deeper,\\ndiscrete scars can be excised. Wide, shallow depressions can be treated with subcision or collagen\\ninjection. Collagen implants are temporary and must be repeated every few years.\\nPerioral Dermatitis\\nPerioral dermatitis is an erythematous, papulopustular facial eruption that resembles acne\\nand/or rosacea but typically starts around the mouth.\\nA variety of causes have been proposed, including exposure to topical corticosteroids and/or fluoride in\\nwater and toothpaste, but the etiology is unknown.

Staphylococcal scalded skin\\nsyndrome (see p. \\n701\\n) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (see p. \\n689\\n) also cause bullae.\\nBullous Pemphigoid\\nBullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune skin disorder causing chronic, pruritic bullous eruptions\\nin elderly patients. Diagnosis is by skin biopsy. Corticosteroids are used initially. Most patients\\nrequire long-term maintenance therapy, for which a variety of drugs can be used.\\nIn bullous pemphigoid, antibodies are directed against the basement membrane zone of the epidermis,\\ncausing separation between the epidermis and dermis. Bullous pemphigoid must be distinguished from\\npemphigus vulgaris (see p. \\n658\\n), a much more serious disease.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCharacteristic tense bullae develop on normal-appearing or erythematous skin, most often in flexural\\nareas. Nikolsky's sign, in which lateral pressure on skin adjacent to a blister causes epidermal\\ndetachment, is negative. Bullous pemphigoid can manifest initially as hives with annular, dusky-red,\\nedematous lesions, with or without peripheral vesicles. Itching is common, usually without other\\nsymptoms. Oral lesions occur in about one third of patients but heal rapidly.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Skin biopsy and antibody titers\\nPatients should have a skin biopsy and serum antibody titers for hemidesmosomal BP antigens BP230\\n(BPAg1) and BP180 (BPAg2).\\nBullous pemphigoid must be differentiated from pemphigus vulgaris (see\\nTable 74-1\\n), linear IgA disease, erythema multiforme, drug-induced eruptions, benign mucous membrane\\npemphigoid, paraneoplastic pemphigoid, dermatitis herpetiformis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis is good, and the disorder usually subsides within months to years; however, the disorder is\\npotentially fatal, especially in the elderly and debilitated patients, with death being caused by infection\\nand sepsis or the effects of the drugs.\\nTreatment\\n• Corticosteroids, topical or oral\\n• Anti-inflammatory drugs\\nMild bullous pemphigoid sometimes resolves without treatment, but resolution usually\\n[\\nTable 74-1.\\n Distinguishing Pemphigoid from Pemphigus Vulgaris]\\ntakes months or years.

For patients with generalized and recalcitrant disease, immunosuppressants such as\\nazathioprine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and cyclosporine may be used. However, use of\\nimmunosuppressants for bullous pemphigoid is controversial.\\nDermatitis Herpetiformis\\nDermatitis herpetiformis is a cutaneous manifestation associated with gluten sensitivity. It\\nproduces a chronic eruption characterized by clusters of intensely pruritic vesicles, papules,\\nand urticaria-like lesions. The cause is autoimmune. Diagnosis is by skin biopsy with direct\\nimmunofluorescence testing.

Patients have a slightly\\nhigher incidence of other autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, sarcoidosis, SLE, and\\nthyroid abnormalities. The incidence of enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma is also increased.\\nThe term herpetiformis refers to the clustered appearance of the lesions rather than a relationship to\\nherpesvirus.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nOnset is usually gradual. Vesicles, papules, and urticaria-like lesions are usually distributed symmetrically\\non extensor aspects (elbows, knees, sacrum, buttocks, occiput). Vesicles and papules occur in about one\\nthird of patients. Itching and burning are severe, and scratching often obscures the primary lesions with\\neczematization of nearby skin, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of eczema. NSAIDs and iodides may\\nworsen the rash.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Skin biopsy\\nDiagnosis is based on skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence testing of a lesion and adjacent\\nnormal-appearing skin. Granular IgA deposition in the dermal papillary tips is invariably present and\\nimportant for diagnosis. Patients should be evaluated for celiac sprue (see p. \\n158\\n).\\nTreatment\\n• Gluten-free diet\\n• Dapsone\\nStrict adherence to a gluten-free diet for a prolonged time (eg, 6 to 12 mo) controls the disease in some\\npatients, obviating or reducing the need for drug therapy. When drugs are needed, dapsone generally\\nresults in remarkable improvement. Initial dosages of dapsone are 25 to 50 mg po once/day in adults and\\n0.5 mg/kg in children.

Diagnosis is by skin biopsy. Lesions respond poorly to corticosteroids. Mild disease may be\\ntreated with colchicine, but more severe disease may require cyclosporine or immune globulin.\\nLinear Immunoglobulin A Disease\\nLinear immunoglobulin A (IgA) disease is an uncommon bullous disease distinguished from\\nbullous pemphigoid and dermatitis herpetiformis by the linear deposits of IgA in the basement\\nmembrane zone.\\nLinear IgA disease occurs in adults and children. The childhood form is most frequently termed chronic\\nbullous disease of childhood.\\nIn linear IgA disease, vesicular or bullous skin lesions occur frequently in a clustered (herpetiform)\\narrangement. There is a predilection for flexural areas (eg, inguinal crease). As in dermatitis herpetiformis,\\nsevere burning and pruritus of cutaneous lesions are prominent features. It was previously considered a\\nform of dermatitis herpetiformis but has no concomitant gluten-sensitive enteropathy and\\nimmunopathology. Also, genetic studies indicate that linear IgA disease is a separate disorder. Drug-\\ninduced linear IgA disease, most commonly associated with vancomycin, has been reported.\\nDiagnosis is by skin biopsy. Dapsone is the treatment of choice. Doses should be similar to those used\\nfor dermatitis herpetiformis (see p. \\n657\\n), and CBC monitoring should follow the same parameters. Other\\ntreatment options include glucocorticoids (systemic, topical, and intralesional), cyclophosphamide,\\nazathioprine, colchicine, tetracycline and nicotinamide, and cyclosporine.\\nPemphigus Vulgaris\\nPemphigus vulgaris is an uncommon, potentially fatal, autoimmune disorder characterized by\\nintraepidermal blisters and extensive erosions on apparently healthy skin and mucous\\nmembranes.

Cornification Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nCornification disorders include calluses, corns, ichthyosis, and keratosis pilaris.\\nCalluses and Corns\\n(Tylomas; Helomas; Clavi)\\nCalluses and corns are circumscribed areas of hyperkeratosis at a site of intermittent pressure\\nor friction. Calluses are more superficial, cover broader areas of skin, and usually\\nasymptomatic. Corns are deeper, more focal, and frequently painful. Diagnosis is by\\nappearance. Treatment is with manual abrasion with or without keratolytics. Prevention\\ninvolves altering biomechanics, such as changing footwear. Rarely, surgery is required.\\nCalluses and corns are caused by intermittent pressure or friction, usually over a bony prominence (eg,\\nheel, metatarsal heads).\\nCorns\\n consist of a sharply circumscribed keratinous plug, pea-sized or slightly larger, which extends\\nthrough most of the underlying dermis. An underlying adventitial bursitis may develop. Hard corns occur\\nover prominent bony protuberances, especially on the toes and plantar surface. Soft corns occur between\\nthe toes. Most corns result from poorly fitting footwear, but small seed-sized corns on non-weight-bearing\\naspects of the soles and palms may represent inherited keratosis punctata.\\nCalluses\\n lack a central plug and have a more even appearance. They usually occur on the hands or feet\\nbut may occur elsewhere, especially in a person whose occupation entails repeated trauma to a particular\\narea (eg, the mandible and clavicle of a violinist).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCalluses are usually asymptomatic but, if friction is extreme, may become irritated, causing mild burning\\ndiscomfort. At times, the discomfort may mimic that of interdigital neuralgia.\\nCorns may be painful or tender when pressure is applied. A bursa or fluid-filled pocket sometimes forms\\nbeneath a corn.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nA corn may be differentiated from a plantar wart or callus by paring away the horny skin. After paring, a\\ncallus shows smooth translucent skin, whereas a wart (see p. \\n715\\n) appears sharply circumscribed,\\nsometimes with soft macerated tissue or with central black dots (bleeding points) representing\\nthrombosed capillaries. A corn, when pared, shows a sharply outlined yellowish to tan translucent core\\nthat interrupts the normal architecture of the papillary dermis. Interdigital neuralgia can be ruled out by the\\nabsence of interspace pain on palpation.\\nTreatment\\n• Manual removal\\n• Keratolytics\\n• Cushioning\\n• Altering foot biomechanics\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 75.

Normal\\nskin may be protected by covering it with petrolatum before application of the keratolytic.\\nCushioning and altering foot biomechanics can help prevent corns and help treat existing corns. Although\\ndifficult to eliminate, pressure on the affected surface should be reduced and redistributed. For foot\\nlesions, soft, well-fitting shoes are important; they should have a roomy toe box so that toes can move\\nfreely in the shoe. Stylish shoes often prevent this freedom of motion. Shoes that increase discomfort of a\\nlesion should be eliminated from the wardrobe. Pads or rings of suitable shapes and sizes, moleskin or\\nfoam-rubber protective bandages, arch inserts (orthotics), or metatarsal plates or bars may help\\nredistribute the pressure. For corns and calluses on the ball of the foot, an orthotic should not be full\\nlength but should extend only to the ball or part of the shoe immediately behind the corn or callus.\\nSurgical off-loading or removal of the offending bone is rarely necessary.\\nPatients who have a tendency to develop calluses and corns may need the regular services of a\\npodiatrist. Patients with impaired peripheral circulation, especially if associated with diabetes, require\\nexpert care.\\nIchthyosis\\nIchthyosis is scaling and flaking of skin ranging from mild but annoying dryness (xeroderma) to\\nsevere disfiguring disease (inherited ichthyosis). Ichthyosis can also be a sign of systemic\\ndisease. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment involves emollients and sometimes oral retinoids.\\nXeroderma:\\n Xeroderma (xerosis), or dry skin, is neither inherited nor associated with systemic\\nabnormalities. Dry skin results from loss of the water content of the skin, resulting in fine white scales.\\nRisk factors for xerosis include the following:\\n• Residence in a dry, cold climate\\n• Older age\\n• Atopic dermatitis\\n• Frequent bathing, particularly if using harsh soaps\\nInherited ichthyoses:\\n Inherited ichthyoses, which are characterized by excessive accumulation of scale\\non the skin surface, are classified according to clinical and genetic criteria (see\\nTable 75-1\\n). Some occur in isolation without\\n[\\nTable 75-1.\\n Clinical and Genetic Features of Some Inherited Ichthyoses]\\nassociated abnormalities (eg, ichthyosis vulgaris, X-linked ichthyosis, lamellar ichthyosis, epidermolytic\\nhyperkeratosis [bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma]). Other ichthyoses are part of a syndrome\\nthat involves multiple organs. For instance, Refsum's disease (see p. \\n3024\\n) and Sjogren-Larsson\\nsyndrome (hereditary intellectual disability and spastic paralysis caused by a defect in fatty aldehyde\\ndehydrogenase) are autosomal recessive conditions with skin and extracutaneous organ involvement. A\\ndermatologist should assist in diagnosis and management, and a medical geneticist should be consulted\\nfor genetic counseling.\\nAcquired ichthyosis:\\n Ichthyosis may be an early manifestation of some systemic disorders (eg, leprosy,\\nhypothyroidism, lymphoma, AIDS). Some drugs cause ichthyosis (eg, nicotinic acid, triparanol,\\nbutyrophenones). The dry scaling may be fine and localized to the trunk and legs, or it may be thick and\\nwidespread. Biopsy of ichthyotic skin is usually not diagnostic of the systemic disorder; however, there\\nare exceptions, most notably sarcoidosis, in which a thick scaling may appear on the legs, and biopsy\\nusually shows the typical granulomas.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 75.

Dermatitis\\nIntroduction\\nDermatitis is superficial inflammation of the skin characterized by redness, edema, oozing, crusting,\\nscaling, and sometimes vesicles. Pruritus is common. Eczema is a term often used interchangeably with\\ndermatitis.\\nAtopic Dermatitis\\nAtopic dermatitis (AD) is an immune-mediated inflammation of the skin arising from an\\ninteraction between genetic and environmental factors. Recent research suggests that a\\nheritable epidermal barrier defect is a primary cause, and defects in the \\nfilaggrin\\n gene have\\nbeen specifically implicated. Pruritus is the primary symptom; skin lesions range from mild\\nerythema to severe lichenification. Diagnosis is by history and examination. Treatment is\\nmoisturizers, avoidance of allergic and irritant triggers, and often topical corticosteroids. Atopic\\ndermatitis frequently resolves completely by age 30.\\nEtiology\\nAD primarily affects children in urban areas or developed countries; at least 5% of children in the US are\\naffected. Like asthma, it may be linked to proallergic/proinflammatory T-cell immune responses. Such\\nresponses are becoming more common in developed countries because trends toward smaller families,\\ncleaner indoor environments, and early use of vaccinations and antibiotics deprive children of the early\\nexposure to infections and allergens that otherwise suppress proallergic T cells and thereby induce\\ntolerance to various antigens.\\nPathophysiology\\nAD can be divided into 2 forms:\\n• Extrinsic: IgE-mediated (70 to 80% of cases)\\n• Intrinsic: Non-IgE-mediated (20 to 30% of cases)\\nExtrinsic AD:\\n This form occurs when environmental exposures trigger immunologic, usually allergic (ie,\\nIgE-mediated), reactions in genetically susceptible people. Common environmental triggers include\\n• Foods (eg, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, peanuts, fish)\\n• Airborne allergens (eg, dust mites, molds, dander)\\n• \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n colonization on skin due to deficiencies in endogenous antimicrobial peptides\\n• Topical products (eg, cosmetics)\\nAD is common within families, suggesting a genetic component. Many patients with AD have a mutation in\\nthe gene encoding for the filaggrin protein, which is a component of the cornified cell envelope produced\\nby differentiating keratinocytes. Also, research has shown that skin affected by AD is deficient in\\nceramides, which increases transepidermal water loss.\\nIntrinsic AD:\\n This form is not mediated by IgE. Intrinsic AD is nonfamilial and idiopathic, and its\\npathophysiology is generally not well understood.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nManifestations of intrinsic and extrinsic AD are similar. AD usually appears in infancy, typically by 3 mo. In\\nthe acute phase, lasting 1 to 2 mo (see\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 76. Dermatitis\\n775'),\n",

In the chronic phase (see\\nPlate 28\\n), scratching and rubbing create skin lesions (typically erythematous macules and papules that\\nlichenify with continued scratching). Lesions typically appear in antecubital and popliteal fossae and on\\nthe eyelids, neck, and wrists and may occasionally become generalized. Lesions slowly resolve to dry\\nscaly macules (xerosis) that can fissure and facilitate exposure to irritants and allergens. In older children\\nand adults, intense pruritus is the key feature. Patients have a reduced threshold for perceiving itch, and\\nitch \\nworsens with allergen exposures, dry air, sweating, local irritation, wool garments, and emotional\\nstress.\\nComplications:\\n Secondary bacterial infections, especially staphylococcal and streptococcal, and\\nregional lymphadenitis are common.\\nEczema herpeticum (Kaposi's varicelliform eruption) is a diffuse herpes simplex infection occurring in\\npatients with AD. It manifests as grouped vesicles in areas of active or recent dermatitis, although normal\\nskin can be involved. High fever and adenopathy may develop after several days. Occasionally, this\\ninfection can become systemic, which may be fatal. Sometimes the eye is involved, causing a painful\\ncorneal lesion.\\nFungal and nonherpetic viral skin infections (eg, common warts, molluscum contagiosum) can also occur.\\nPatients with long-standing AD may develop cataracts in their 20s or 30s.\\nFrequent use of topical products exposes the patient to many potential allergens, and contact dermatitis\\nmay aggravate and complicate AD, as may the generally dry skin that is common among these patients.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Sometimes testing for allergic triggers with skin prick testing or radioallergosorbent testing levels\\nDiagnosis is clinical (see\\nTable 76-1\\n). AD is often hard to differentiate from other dermatoses (eg, seborrheic dermatitis, contact\\ndermatitis, nummular dermatitis, psoriasis), although a family history of atopy and the distribution of\\nlesions are helpful. For example, psoriasis is usually extensor rather than flexurally distributed, may\\ninvolve the fingernails, and has a shinier (micaceous) scale. Seborrheic dermatitis affects the face (eg,\\nnasolabial folds, eyebrows, glabellar region, scalp) most commonly. Nummular dermatitis is not flexural,\\nand lichenification is rare. Because patients can still develop other skin disorders, not all subsequent skin\\nproblems should be attributed to AD.\\nThere is no definitive laboratory test for AD. However, allergic precipitants of AD can be identified with\\nskin testing, measurement of allergen-specific IgE levels, or both.\\nPrognosis\\nAD in children often abates by age 5 yr, although exacerbations are common throughout adolescence and\\ninto adulthood. Girls and patients with severe disease, early age of onset, family history, and associated\\nrhinitis or asthma are more likely to have prolonged disease. Even in these patients, AD frequently\\nresolves completely by age 30.

Bathing and hand washing should be infrequent, and\\nlukewarm (not hot) water should be used; soap use should be minimized on dermatitic areas because it\\nmay be drying and irritating. Colloidal oatmeal baths can be helpful. When toweling dry, the skin should\\nbe blotted or patted dry rather than rubbed.\\nBody oils or emollients such as white petrolatum, vegetable oil, or hydrophilic petrolatum (unless the\\npatient is allergic to lanolin) applied immediately after bathing may help retain skin moisture and reduce\\nitching. Continuously wet dressings (not wet-to-dry) are an alternative for severe lesions. Coal tar cream\\nor oil can be an effective topical anti-pruritic but also can be inconvenient because it stains clothing.\\nAntihistamines can help relieve pruritus. Options include hydroxyzine 25 mg po tid or qid (for children, 0.5\\nmg/kg q 6 h or 2 mg/kg in a single bedtime dose) and diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg po at bedtime. Low-\\nsedating H\\n1\\n receptor blockers, such as loratadine 10 mg po once/day, fexofenadine 60 mg po bid or 180\\nmg po once/day, and cetirizine 5 to 10 mg po once/day, may be useful, although their efficacy has not\\nbeen defined.

Fingernails should\\nbe cut short to minimize excoriations and secondary infections.\\nAvoidance of precipitating factors:\\n Household antigens can be controlled by using synthetic fiber\\npillows and impermeable mattress covers; washing bedding in hot water; removing upholstered furniture,\\nsoft toys, carpets, and pets (to reduce dust mites and animal dander); using air circulators equipped with\\nhigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in bedrooms and other frequently occupied living areas; and\\nusing dehumidifiers in basements and other poorly aerated damp rooms (to reduce molds). Reduction of\\nemotional stress is useful but often difficult. Antistaphylococcal antibiotics, both topical (eg, mupirocin,\\nfusidic acid) and oral (eg, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, erythromycin [all 250 mg qid]), can control \\nS. aureus\\nnasal colonization and are indicated in patients with severe disease unresponsive to specific therapies\\nand positive nasal cultures. Extensive dietary changes intended to eliminate exposure to allergenic foods\\nare unnecessary and probably ineffective; food hypersensitivities rarely persist beyond childhood.\\nCorticosteroids:\\n Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy. Creams or ointments applied twice daily\\nare effective for most patients with mild or moderate disease. Emollients are applied between\\ncorticosteroid applications and can be mixed with them to decrease the corticosteroid amount required to\\ncover an area. Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 60 mg or, for children 1 mg/kg, po once/day for short\\ncourses of 7 to 14 days) are indicated for extensive or refractory disease but should be avoided\\nwhenever possible, because disease often recurs and topical therapy is safer. Prolonged, widespread\\nuse of high-potency corticosteroid creams or ointments should be avoided in infants because adrenal\\nsuppression may ensue.\\nOther therapies:\\n Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are T-cell inhibitors effective for AD. They should be used\\nwhen patients do not respond to corticosteroids and tar or when corticosteroid adverse effects such as\\nskin atrophy, striae formation, or adrenal suppression is a concern.

Treatment entails antipruritics, topical\\ncorticosteroids, and avoidance of causes.\\nPathophysiology\\nCD is caused by irritants or allergens.\\nIrritant contact dermatitis (ICD):\\n ICD accounts for 80% of all cases of CD. It is a nonspecific\\ninflammatory reaction to substances contacting the skin; the immune system is not activated. Numerous\\nsubstances are involved, including\\n• Chemicals (eg, acids, alkalis, solvents, metal salts)\\n• Soaps (eg, abrasives, detergents)\\n• Plants (eg, poinsettias, peppers)\\n• Body fluids (eg, urine, saliva)\\nProperties of the irritant (eg, extreme pH, solubility in the lipid film on skin), environment (eg, low humidity,\\nhigh temperature, high friction), and patient (eg, very young or old) influence the likelihood of developing\\nICD. ICD is more common among patients with atopic disorders, in whom ICD also may initiate\\nimmunologic sensitization and hence allergic CD.\\nPhototoxic dermatitis\\n (see p. \\n675\\n) is a variant in which topical (eg, perfumes, coal tar) or ingested (eg,\\npsoralens) agents generate damaging free radicals and inflammatory mediators only after absorption of\\nultraviolet light.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis (ACD):\\n ACD is a type IV cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that has 2\\nphases:\\n• Sensitization to an antigen\\n• Allergic response after reexposure\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 76.

The process may\\nbe brief (6 to 10 days for strong sensitizers such as poison ivy) or prolonged (years for weak sensitizers\\nsuch as sunscreens, fragrances, and glucocorticoids). Sensitized T cells then migrate back to the\\nepidermis and activate on any reexposure to the allergen, releasing cytokines, recruiting inflammatory\\ncells, and leading to the characteristic symptoms and signs of ACD.\\nIn \\nautoeczematization\\n, epidermal T cells activated by an allergen migrate locally or through the\\ncirculation to cause dermatitis at sites remote from the initial trigger. However, contact with fluid from\\nvesicles or blisters cannot trigger a reaction elsewhere on the patient or on another person.\\nMultiple allergens cause ACD (see\\nTable 76-2\\n), and cross-sensitization among agents is common (eg, between benzocaine and\\nparaphenylenediamine). Cross-sensitization means that exposure to one substance can result in an\\nallergic response after exposure to a different but related substance.\\nACD variants include photoallergic CD and systemically induced ACD. In photoallergic CD (see p. \\n675\\n), a\\nsubstance becomes sensitizing only after it undergoes structural change triggered by ultraviolet light.\\nTypical causes include aftershave lotions, sunscreens, and topical sulfonamides. Reactions may extend\\nto non-sun-exposed skin. In systemically induced ACD, ingestion of an allergen after topical sensitization\\ncauses diffuse dermatitis (eg, oral diphenhydramine after sensitization with topical diphenhydramine).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nICD:\\n ICD is more painful than pruritic. Signs range from mild erythema to hemorrhage, crusting, erosion,\\npustules, bullae, and edema.\\nACD:\\n In ACD, the primary symptom is intense pruritus; pain is usually the result of excoriation or infection.\\nSkin changes range from transient erythema through vesiculation to severe swelling with bullae,\\nulceration, or both. Changes often occur in a pattern, distribution, or combination that suggests a specific\\nexposure, such as linear streaking on an arm or leg (eg, from brushing against poison ivy) or\\ncircumferential erythema (under a wristwatch or waistband).

Reactions to Sunlight\\nIntroduction\\nThe skin may respond to excessive sunlight in several ways: various chronic changes (eg,\\ndermatoheliosis, actinic keratoses), photosensitivity, or sunburn.\\nUltraviolet (UV) radiation:\\n Although the sun emits a wide range of UV electromagnetic radiation (ie,\\nUVA, 320 to 400 nm; UVB, 280 to 320 nm; UVC, 100 to 280 nm), only UVA and UVB reach the earth\\'s\\nsurface. The character and amount of such radiation vary greatly with the seasons and with changing\\natmospheric conditions. Exposure of skin to sunlight depends on multiple lifestyle factors, (eg, clothing,\\noccupation), geographic factors (eg, altitude, latitude), and time of year (UV intensity is higher in\\nsummer).\\nSunburn-producing rays (primarily wavelengths < 320 nm) are filtered out by glass and to a great extent\\nby smoke and smog. Sunburn-producing rays may pass through light clouds, fog, or 30 cm of clear water,\\ncausing severe burns in unsuspecting people. Snow, sand, and water enhance exposure by reflecting the\\nrays. Stratospheric ozone, which filters out shorter wavelengths of UV, is depleted by man-made\\nchlorofluorocarbons (eg, in refrigerants \\nand aerosols). A decreased ozone layer increases inadvertent\\nexposure to UVA and UVB.\\nSun-tanning lamps use artificial light that is more UVA than UVB. This UVA use is often advertised as a\\n\"safer\" way to tan; however, many of the same long-term deleterious effects may occur as with UVB\\nexposure, including photoaging and skin cancer. Quite simply, there is no \"safe tan.\"\\nPathophysiology\\nAfter exposure to sunlight, the epidermis thickens, and melanocytes produce the pigment melanin at an\\nincreased rate, causing tanning. Tanning provides some natural protection against future exposure.\\nExposure leads to both inactivation and loss of epidermal Langerhans\\' cells, which are immunologically\\nimportant.\\nPeople differ greatly in their sensitivity and response to sunlight based on the amount of melanin in their\\nskin. Skin is classified into 6 types (I to VI) in decreasing order of susceptibility to sun injury. Classification\\nis based on skin color, UV sensitivity, and response to sun exposure. Skin type I is white to lightly\\npigmented, very sensitive to UV light, has no immediate pigment darkening, always burns easily, and\\nnever tans. Skin type VI is dark brown or black, least sensitive to UV light, has significant immediate\\npigment darkening, and tans profusely (deep black). Dark-skinned people are not immune to the effects\\nof the sun and can become sunburned with strong or prolonged exposure. Long-term effects of UV\\nexposure in dark-skinned people are the same as those in light-skinned people but are often delayed and\\nless severe. People with blonde or red hair are especially susceptible to the acute and chronic effects of\\nUV radiation. Uneven melanocyte activation occurs in many fair-haired people and results in freckling.\\nThere is no skin pigmentation in people with albinism (see p. \\n719\\n) because of a defect in melanin\\nmetabolism. Patchy areas of depigmentation are present in patients with vitiligo (see p. \\n720\\n) because of\\nimmunologic destruction of melanocytes.\\nPrevention\\nAvoidance:\\n Simple precautions help prevent sunburn and the chronic effects of sunlight. These\\nprecautions are recommended for people of all skin types, particularly those who are fair skinned and\\nburn easily. Exposure to bright midday sun should not be > 30 min, even for people with dark skin. In\\ntemperate zones, exposure is less hazardous before 10 AM and after 3 PM because more sunburn-\\nproducing wavelengths are filtered out. Fog and clouds do not reduce risk, and risk is increased at high\\naltitude.\\nClothing:\\n Skin should be covered. Fabrics with a tight weave block the sun better than do those with a\\nloose weave. Special clothing that provides high sun protection is commercially available. Broad-brimmed\\nhats protect the face, ears, and neck. Regular use of UV-protective, wrap-around sunglasses helps shield\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 77. Reactions to Sunlight\\n786'),\n",

Older sunscreens tended to filter only UVB light, but many newer\\nsunscreens are now \"full spectrum\" and effectively filter UVA light as well. In the US, the FDA rates\\nsunscreens by sun protection factor (SPF): the higher the number, the greater the protection. Agents with\\nSPF ≥ 15 are recommended. The SPF, however, only quantifies the protection against UVB exposure;\\nthere is no scale for UVA protection.\\nSunscreens are available in a wide variety of formulations, including creams, gels, foams, sprays, and\\nsticks. Self-tanning products do not provide significant protection from UV exposure.\\nMost sunscreens contain several agents that function as chemical screens, absorbing light or providing a\\nphysical screen that reflects or scatters light. Common chemical sunscreen agents mostly absorb UVB\\nrays and include the aminobenzoates, which include \\np\\n-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), salicylates,\\ncinnamates, benzophenones (eg, avobenzone), and the anthrilates (an aminobenzoate derivative). Of\\nthese, the benzophenones are particularly effective at screening UVA rays.\\nOther sunscreens, called sunblocks, contain zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which physically block both\\nUVB and UVA rays. Micronized formulations of these products have significantly improved their cosmetic\\nacceptability.\\nSunscreen failure is common and usually results from insufficient application of the product, application\\ntoo late (sunscreens should optimally be applied 30 min before exposure), or failure to reapply after\\nswimming or exercise.\\nAllergic or photoallergic reactions to sunscreens must be distinguished from other photosensitive skin\\neruptions. Patch or photopatch testing with sunscreen components may be necessary to make the\\ndiagnosis. This testing is usually done by dermatologists with a particular expertise in allergic contact\\ndermatitis.\\nChronic Effects of Sunlight\\nAging:\\n Chronic exposure to sunlight ages the skin (dermatoheliosis, extrinsic aging), producing both fine\\nand coarse wrinkles, rough leathery texture, mottled pigmentation, and telangiectasia. The atrophic\\neffects in some people may resemble those seen after x-ray therapy (chronic radiation dermatitis).\\nActinic keratoses:\\n Actinic keratoses are precancerous changes in skin cells (keratinocytes) that are a\\nfrequent, disturbing consequence of many years of sun exposure. People with blonde or red hair, blue\\neyes, and skin type I or II are particularly susceptible.\\nThe keratoses are usually pink or red, poorly marginated, and scaly on palpation, although some are light\\ngray or pigmented, giving them a brown appearance. They should be differentiated from seborrheic\\nkeratoses (see p. \\n746\\n), which increase in number and size with aging. Seborrheic keratoses tend to\\nappear waxy and stuck-on but can often take on an appearance similar to actinic keratoses. Close\\ninspection usually reveals distinguishing characteristics of the lesion. Unlike actinic keratoses, seborrheic\\nkeratoses also occur on non-sun-exposed areas of the body and are not premalignant.\\nSkin cancers\\n (see p. \\n748\\n)\\n:\\n The incidence of squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma in fair,\\nlight-skinned people is directly proportional to the total annual sunlight in the area. Such lesions are\\nespecially common among people who were extensively exposed to sunlight as children and adolescents\\nand among those who are chronically exposed to the sun as part of their profession or recreational\\nactivities (eg, athletes, farmers, ranchers, sailors, frequent sunbathers).

Lasers are capable of treating both superficial and deep changes in the dermis and are\\nused to treat cosmetic and precancerous skin changes. Many chemicals are used in OTC cosmetic\\nproducts without significant evidence that they improve chronic changes of the skin caused by sunlight.\\nActinic keratoses:\\n There are several options, depending on the number and location of lesions.\\n• Liquid nitrogen\\n• Topical 5-FU\\n• Topical imiquimod\\nIf only a few actinic keratoses are present, cryotherapy (freezing with liquid nitrogen) is the most rapid\\nand satisfactory treatment.\\nIf there are too many lesions to freeze, topical 5-FU applied to the affected area nightly or twice daily for 2\\nto 6 wk often clears the majority of lesions.

Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment varies by type.\\nIn addition to the acute and chronic effects of sunlight, a variety of unusual reactions may \\noccur soon\\nafter only a brief sun exposure. Unless the cause is obvious, patients with pronounced photosensitivity\\nshould be evaluated for systemic or cutaneous disorders associated with light sensitivity such as SLE\\n(see p. \\n305\\n) and porphyria (see p. \\n807\\n). Treatment for chemical photosensitivity is topical corticosteroids\\nand avoidance of the causative substance.\\nSolar urticaria:\\n In certain patients, urticaria develops at a site of sun exposure within a few minutes.\\nRarely, if large areas are involved, syncope, dizziness, wheezing, and other systemic symptoms may\\ndevelop. Etiology is unclear but may involve endogenous skin constituents functioning as photoallergens,\\nleading to mast cell degranulation as in other types of urticaria. Solar urticaria can be distinguished from\\nother types of urticaria in that wheals in solar urticaria occur only on exposed skin after ultraviolet (UV)\\nlight exposure. Solar urticaria can be classified based on the component of the UV spectrum (UVA, UVB,\\nand visible light) that produces them. Treatment can be difficult and may include H\\n1\\n blockers, antimalarial\\ndrugs, topical corticosteroids, sunscreens, and psoralen UV light (PUVA).

A limited number are responsible for most\\nreactions (see\\nTable 77-1\\n). Reactions are divided into phototoxicity and photoallergy.\\nIn \\nphototoxicity\\n, light-absorbing compounds directly generate free radicals and inflammatory mediators,\\ncausing tissue damage manifesting as pain and erythema (like sunburn). This reaction does not require\\nprior sun exposure and can appear in any person, although reaction is highly variable. Typical causes of\\nphototoxic reactions include topical (eg, perfumes, coal tar) or ingested (eg, tetracyclines, psoralen-\\ncontaining plants) agents. Phototoxic reactions do not generalize to non-sun-exposed skin.\\nPhotoallergy\\n is a type IV (cell-mediated) immune response; light absorption causes structural changes in\\nthe drug or substance, allowing it to bind to tissue protein and function as a hapten. Prior exposure is\\nrequired. Typical causes of photoallergic reactions include aftershave lotions, sunscreens, and\\nsulfonamides. Reaction may extend to non-sun-exposed skin.

Eruptions appear on sun-exposed areas, usually 30 min to\\nseveral hours after exposure. Lesions are pruritic, erythematous, and often papular but may be\\npapulovesicular or plaquelike. They are most common among women and people from northern climates\\nwhen first exposed to spring or summer sun than among those exposed to sun year-round. Lesions\\nsubside within several days to 1 wk or so. Actinic prurigo is a similar (perhaps related) phenomenon with\\nmore nodular-appearing lesions that may persist year-round, worsening with sun exposure.\\nDiagnosis is made by history, skin findings, and exclusion of other sun-sensitivity disorders. Diagnosis\\nsometimes requires reproduction of the lesions with artificial or natural \\nsunlight when the patient is not\\nusing any potentially sensitizing drugs.\\nOften, lesions are self-limited and spontaneously improve as summer progresses. Treatment is by\\nmoderating sun exposure and applying topical corticosteroids. More severely affected patients may\\nbenefit from desensitization by graduated exposure to UV light with PUVA (see p. \\n679\\n) or narrow band\\nUVB (312 nm) phototherapy.

Treatment is with emollients, vitamin D analogs,\\nretinoids, tar, anthralin, corticosteroids, phototherapy, and, when severe, methotrexate,\\nretinoids, immunomodulatory agents (biologics), or immunosuppressants.\\nPsoriasis is hyperproliferation of epidermal keratinocytes combined with inflammation of the epidermis\\nand dermis.

The mechanism\\nof action is unknown, although UVB light reduces DNA synthesis and can induce mild systemic\\nimmunosuppression. In PUVA, oral methoxypsoralen, a photosensitizer, is followed by exposure to long-\\nwave UVA light (330 to 360 nm). PUVA has an antiproliferative effect and also helps to normalize\\nkeratinocyte differentiation. Doses of light are started low and increased as tolerated. Severe burns can\\nresult if the dose of drug or UVA is too high. Although the treatment is less messy than topical treatment\\nand may produce remissions lasting several months, repeated treatments may increase the incidence of\\nUV-induced skin cancer and melanoma. Less UV light is required when used with oral retinoids (the so-\\ncalled re-PUVA regimen). Narrow-band UVB light (311 to 312 nm) used without psoralens is similar in\\neffectiveness to PUVA. Excimer laser therapy is a type of phototherapy using extremely pure\\nwavelengths.\\nChoice of therapy:\\n Choice of specific agents and combinations requires close cooperation with the\\npatient, always keeping in mind the untoward effects of the treatments. There is no single ideal\\ncombination or sequence of \\nagents, but treatment should be kept as simple as possible. Monotherapy is\\npreferred, but combination therapy is the norm. Rotational therapy refers to the substitution of one\\ntherapy for another after 1 to 2 yr to reduce the adverse effects caused by chronic use and to circumvent\\ndisease resistance. Sequential therapy refers to initial use of potent agents (eg, cyclosporine) to quickly\\ngain control followed by use of agents with a better safety profile.\\nMild plaque psoriasis\\n can be treated with emollients, keratolytics, tar, topical corticosteroids, vitamin D\\n3\\nanalogs, or anthralin alone or in combination.

Immunomodulatory agents (biologics) are used for\\nmoderate to severe disease unresponsive to other agents.\\nScalp plaques\\n are notoriously difficult to treat because they resist systemic therapy, and because hair\\nblocks application of topical agents and scale removal and shields skin from UV light. A suspension of\\n10% salicylic acid in mineral oil may be rubbed into the scalp at bedtime manually or with a toothbrush,\\ncovered with a shower cap (to enhance penetration and avoid messiness), and washed out the next\\nmorning with a tar (or other) shampoo. More cosmetically acceptable corticosteroid solutions can be\\napplied to the scalp during the day. These treatments are continued until the desired clinical response is\\nachieved. Resistant skin or scalp patches may respond to local superficial intralesional injection of\\ntriamcinolone acetonide suspension diluted with saline to 2.5 or 5 mg/mL, depending on the size and\\nseverity of the lesion. Injections may cause local atrophy, which is usually reversible.\\nSpecial treatment needs for subtypes are described in \\nTable 78-1\\n.\\nFor psoriatic arthritis, treatment with systemic therapy is important to prevent joint destruction;\\nmethotrexate or a TNF-\\nα\\n inhibitor may be effective.\\nParapsoriasis\\nParapsoriasis describes a poorly understood and poorly distinguished group of diseases that share\\nclinical features.

A general centripetal eruption of 0.5- to 2-cm rose- or fawn-colored oval papules and plaques\\nfollows within 7 to 14 days. The lesions have a scaly, slightly raised border (collarette) and resemble\\nringworm (tinea corporis). Most patients itch, occasionally severely. Papules may dominate with little or no\\nscaling in blacks, children, and pregnant women. The rose or fawn color is not as evident in blacks;\\nblacks also more commonly have inverse PR (lesions in the axillae or groin that spread centrifugally).\\nClassically, lesions orient along skin lines, giving PR a Christmas tree-like distribution when multiple\\nlesions appear on the back. A prodrome of malaise and headache precedes the lesions in a minority of\\npatients.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nDiagnosis is based on clinical appearance and distribution. Differential diagnosis includes tinea corporis,\\ntinea versicolor, drug eruptions, psoriasis, parapsoriasis, pityriasis lichenoides chronica, lichen planus,\\nand secondary syphilis. Serologic testing for syphilis is indicated when the palms or soles are affected,\\nwhen a herald patch is not seen, or when lesions occur in an unusual sequence or distribution.\\nTreatment\\n• Antipruritic therapy\\nNo specific treatment is necessary because the eruption usually remits within 5 wk and recurrence is rare.\\nArtificial or natural sunlight may hasten resolution.

The acute form\\ntypically appears in children and young adults, with crops of asymptomatic chickenpox-like lesions that\\ntypically resolve within weeks to months. Antibiotics (eg, tetracycline, erythromycin) or phototherapy may\\nhelp.\\nThe chronic form initially manifests as flatter, reddish brown, scaling papules that may take months or\\nlonger to resolve. No treatment has proved effective.\\nLichen Planus\\nLichen planus (LP) is a recurrent, pruritic, inflammatory eruption characterized by small,\\ndiscrete, polygonal, flat-topped, violaceous papules that may coalesce into rough scaly patches,\\noften accompanied by oral lesions. Diagnosis is usually clinical and supported by skin biopsy.\\nTreatment generally requires topical or intralesional corticosteroids. Severe cases may require\\nphototherapy or systemic immunosuppressants.\\nEtiology\\nLP is thought to be caused by a T cell-mediated autoimmune reaction against basal epithelial\\nkeratinocytes in people with genetic predisposition. Drugs (especially \\nβ\\n-blockers, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors,\\nsulfonylureas, gold, antimalarial drugs, penicillamine, and thiazides) can cause LP; drug-induced LP\\n(sometimes called lichenoid drug eruption) may be indistinguishable from nondrug-induced LP or may\\nhave a pattern that is more eczematous. Associations with hepatitis C-induced liver insufficiency, primary\\nbiliary cirrhosis, and other forms of hepatitis have been reported.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nTypical lesions are pruritic, purple, polygonal, flat-topped papules and plaques (see\\nPlate 39\\n). Lesions initially are 2 to 4 mm in diameter, with angular borders, a violaceous color, and a\\ndistinct sheen in cross-lighting.

Recent evidence suggests that\\nEM is different from these other disorders.\\nEtiology\\nThe majority of cases are caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection (HSV-1 more so than HSV-2),\\nalthough it is unclear whether EM lesions represent a specific or nonspecific reaction to the virus. Current\\nthinking holds that EM is caused by a T-cell-mediated cytolytic reaction to HSV DNA fragments present in\\nkeratinocytes.

EM that occurs in patients with SLE is sometimes referred to as Rowell's syndrome.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nEM manifests as the sudden onset of asymptomatic, erythematous macules, papules, wheals, vesicles,\\nbullae, or a combination on the distal extremities (including palms and soles) and face. The classic lesion\\nis annular, with a violaceous center and pink halo separated by a pale ring (target or iris lesion).\\nDistribution is symmetric and centripetal; spread to the trunk is common.

Sweating Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThere are two types of sweat glands: apocrine and eccrine.\\nApocrine glands are clustered in the axillae, areolae, genitals, and anus; modified apocrine glands are\\nfound in the external auditory meatus. Apocrine glands become active at puberty; their excretions are oily\\nand viscid and are presumed to play a role in sexual olfactory messages. The most common disorders of\\napocrine glands are bromhidrosis and hidradenitis suppurativa (see p. \\n698\\n).\\nEccrine glands are sympathetically innervated, distributed over the entire body, and active from birth.\\nTheir secretions are watery and serve to cool the body in hot environments or during activity. Disorders of\\neccrine glands include hyperhidrosis, hypohidrosis, and miliaria.\\nBromhidrosis\\nBromhidrosis is excessive or abnormal body odor caused by decomposition by bacteria and\\nyeasts of apocrine secretions and cellular debris.\\nApocrine secretions are lipid-rich, sterile, and odorless but become odoriferous when decomposed.\\nEccrine bromhidrosis is not as fragrant because eccrine sweat is nearly 100% water. The cause of\\napocrine bromhidrosis is poor hygiene of skin and clothing.\\nIn some people, a few days of washing with an antiseptic soap, which may be combined with use of\\nantibacterial creams containing clindamycin or erythromycin, may be necessary. Shaving the hair in the\\narmpits may also help control odor.\\nHyperhidrosis\\nHyperhidrosis is excessive sweating, which can be focal or diffuse and has multiple causes.\\nSweating of the axillae, palms, and soles is most often due to stress; diffuse sweating is usually\\nidiopathic but should raise suspicions for cancer, infection, and endocrine disease. Diagnosis is\\nobvious, but tests for underlying causes may be indicated. Treatment is topical aluminum\\nchloride, tap water iontophoresis, botulinum toxin, and, in extreme cases, surgery.\\nEtiology\\nHyperhidrosis can be focal or generalized.\\nFocal sweating:\\n Emotional causes are common, causing sweating on the palms, soles, axillae, and\\nforehead at times of anxiety, excitement, anger, or fear. It may be due to a generalized stress-increased\\nsympathetic outflow. Although such sweating is a normal response, patients with hyperhidrosis sweat\\nexcessively and under conditions that do not cause sweating in most people.\\nGustatory sweating occurs around the lips and mouth when ingesting foods and beverages that are spicy\\nor hot in temperature. There is no known cause in most cases, but gustatory sweating can be increased\\nin diabetic neuropathy, facial herpes zoster, cervical sympathetic ganglion invasion, CNS injury or\\ndisease, or parotid gland injury. In the case of parotid gland injury, surgery, infection, or trauma may\\ndisrupt parotid gland innervation and lead to regrowth of parotid parasympathetic fibers into sympathetic\\nfibers innervating local sweat glands in skin where the injury took place, usually over the parotid gland.\\nThis condition is called Frey's syndrome.\\nOther causes of focal sweating include pretibial myxedema (shins), hypertrophic osteoarthropathy\\n(palms), and blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome and glomus tumor (over lesions).

The solution\\nblocks sweat ducts and is most effective when applied nightly and covered tightly with a thin\\npolyvinylidene or polyethylene film; it should be washed off in the morning. Sometimes an anticholinergic\\ndrug is taken before applying to prevent sweat from washing the aluminum chloride away.

A skin infection is considered complicated when it\\nmeets 2 of the following 5 criteria:\\n• Involves a preexisting wound or ulceration of the skin\\n• Involves the deeper soft tissues\\n• Requires surgical intervention\\n• Is caused or exacerbated by underlying comorbid disease states (eg diabetes, systemic\\nimmunosuppression)\\n• Is unresponsive to conventional antibiotic therapy or is recurrent\\nAll uncomplicated skin infections have the potential to become complicated. Complicated skin and soft-\\ntissue infections may require multidrug therapy and the assistance of other consultants (eg, surgeons,\\ninfectious disease specialists), particularly in light of resistance in many strains of bacteria and the rapid\\nloss of efficacy among more potent antibiotics. Recurrent skin infections should raise suspicion of\\ncolonization (eg, staphylococcal nasal carriage), resistant strains of bacteria (eg, methicillin-resistant\\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n [MRSA]), cancer, poorly controlled diabetes, or other reasons for\\nimmunocompromise (eg, HIV, hepatitis, advanced age, congenital susceptibility). Bacteria are involved in\\nthe pathophysiology of acne, but acne is not primarily considered a bacterial skin infection.\\nCellulitis\\nCellulitis is acute bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue most often caused by\\nstreptococci or staphylococci. Symptoms and signs are pain, rapidly spreading erythema, and\\nedema; fever may occur, and regional lymph nodes may enlarge. Diagnosis is by appearance;\\ncultures are sometimes helpful but awaiting culture results should not delay empiric therapy.\\nTreatment is with antibiotics. Prognosis is excellent with timely treatment.\\nEtiology\\n• \\nStreptococcus pyogenes\\n• \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\nCellulitis is most often caused by group A \\nβ\\n-hemolytic streptococci (eg, \\nStreptococcus pyogenes\\n) or\\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n. Streptococci cause diffuse, rapidly spreading infection because enzymes\\nproduced by the organism (streptokinase, DNase, hyaluronidase) break down cellular components that\\nwould otherwise contain and localize the inflammation. Staphylococcal cellulitis is typically more localized\\nand usually occurs in open wounds or cutaneous abscesses.\\nRecently, methicillin-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n (MRSA) has become more common in the community\\n(community-associated MRSA [CA-MRSA]). Historically, MRSA was typically confined to patients who\\nwere exposed to the organism in a hospital or nursing facility. MRSA infection should now be considered\\nin patients with community-acquired cellulitis, particularly in those with cellulitis that is recurrent or\\nunresponsive to monotherapy.\\nLess common causes are group B streptococci (eg, \\nStreptococcus agalactiae\\n) in older patients with\\ndiabetes; gram-negative bacilli (eg, \\nHaemophilus influenzae\\n) in children; and \\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\\nin patients with diabetes or neutropenia, hot tub or spa users, and hospitalized patients.

Cellulitis is typically unilateral; stasis dermatitis closely\\nmimics cellulitis but is usually bilateral. The major findings are local erythema and tenderness, frequently\\nwith lymphangitis and regional lymphadenopathy. The skin is hot, red, and edematous (see\\nPlate 31\\n), often with surface appearance resembling the skin of an orange (peau d'orange). The borders\\nare usually indistinct, except in erysipelas (a type of cellulitis with sharply demarcated margins—see p.\\n696\\n). Petechiae are common; large areas of ecchymosis are rare. Vesicles and bullae may develop and\\nrupture, occasionally with necrosis of the involved skin. Cellulitis may mimic deep venous thrombosis but\\ncan often be differentiated by one or more features (see\\nTable 81-1\\n). Fever, chills, tachycardia, headache, hypotension, and delirium may precede cutaneous\\nfindings by several hours, but many patients do not appear ill. Leukocytosis is common.\\n[\\nTable 81-1.\\n Differentiating Cellulitis and Deep Venous Thrombosis]\\nDiagnosis\\n• Examination\\n• Blood and sometimes tissue cultures for immunocompromised patients\\nDiagnosis is by examination. Skin and (when present) wound cultures are generally not indicated\\nbecause they rarely identify the infecting organism. Blood cultures are useful in immunocompromised\\npatients to detect or rule out bacteremia. Culture of involved tissue may be required in\\nimmunocompromised patients if they are not responding to empiric therapy or if blood cultures do not\\nisolate an organism.\\nPrognosis\\nMost cellulitis resolves quickly with antibiotic therapy. Local abscesses occasionally form, requiring\\nincision and drainage. Serious but rare complications include severe necrotizing subcutaneous infection\\n(see p. \\n700\\n) and bacteremia with metastatic foci of infection.\\nRecurrences in the same area are common, sometimes causing serious damage to the lymphatics,\\nchronic lymphatic obstruction, and lymphedema.\\nTreatment\\n• Antibiotics\\nTreatment is with antibiotics. For most patients, empiric treatment effective against both group A\\nstreptococci and \\nS. aureus\\n is used. Oral therapy is usually adequate with dicloxacillin 250 mg or\\ncephalexin 500 mg qid for mild infections. Levofloxacin 500 mg po once/day or moxifloxacin 400 mg\\nonce/day works well for patients who are unlikely to adhere to multiple daily dosing schedules. For more\\nserious infections, oxacillin or nafcillin 1 g IV q 6 h is given. Use of initial empiric therapy against MRSA is\\nnot typically advised unless there is compelling clinical evidence (eg, contact with a documented case or\\noutbreak; culture-documented prevalence of > 10% or 15% in a practice area).

Linezolid is another option for the treatment of MRSA at a dose of 600 mg IV or\\npo q 12 h for 10 to 14 days. Teicoplanin has a mechanism of action similar to vancomycin. It is commonly\\nused outside the US to treat MRSA; the usual dose is 6 mg/kg IV q 12 h for 2 doses, followed by 6 mg/kg\\n(or 3 mg/kg) IV or IM once/day.

If these regimens prove unsuccessful, tissue\\nculture may be required.\\nErysipelas\\nErysipelas is a type of superficial cellulitis (see p. \\n694\\n) with dermal lymphatic involvement.\\nErysipelas should not be confused with erysipeloid, a skin infection caused by \\nErysipelothrix\\n (see p.\\n1241\\n). Erysipelas is characterized clinically by shiny, raised, indurated, and tender plaque-like lesions\\nwith distinct margins (see\\nPlate 33\\n). There is also a bullous form of erysipelas. Erysipelas is most often caused by group A (or rarely\\ngroup C or G) \\nβ\\n-hemolytic streptococci and occurs most frequently on the legs and face. However, other\\ncauses have been reported, including \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n (including methicillin-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n[MRSA]), \\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\\n, \\nHaemophilus influenzae\\n, \\nEscherichia coli\\n, \\nS. warneri\\n, \\nStreptococcus\\npneumoniae\\n, \\nS. pyogenes\\n, and \\nMoraxella\\n sp. Erysipelas of the face must be differentiated from herpes\\nzoster, angioedema, and contact dermatitis. It is commonly accompanied by high fever, chills, and\\nmalaise; MRSA is more common in facial erysipelas than in lower-extremity erysipelas. Erysipelas may be\\nrecurrent and may result in chronic lymphedema.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is by characteristic appearance; blood culture is done in toxic-appearing patients. Diffuse\\ninflammatory carcinoma of the breast may also be mistaken for erysipelas.\\nTreatment\\n• Usually penicillin for lower-extremity erysipelas\\n• Initially vancomycin for facial erysipelas\\nTreatment of choice for lower-extremity erysipelas is penicillin V 500 mg po qid for ≥ 2 wk. In severe\\ncases, penicillin G 1.2 million units IV q 6 h is indicated, which can be replaced by oral therapy after 36 to\\n48 h. Dicloxacillin 500 mg po qid for 10 days can be used for infections with staphylococci. Erythromycin\\n500 mg po qid for 10 days may be used in penicillin-allergic patients; however, there is growing macrolide\\nresistance in streptococci. In infections resistant to these antibiotics, cloxacillin or nafcillin can be used. In\\nEurope, pristinamycin and roxithromycin have been shown to be good choices for erysipelas. If facial\\nerysipelas is present or if MRSA is otherwise suspected, empiric therapy should be initiated with\\nvancomycin 1 g IV q 12 h (which is active against MRSA). Cold packs and analgesics may relieve local\\ndiscomfort. Fungal foot infections may be an entry site for infection and may require antifungal treatment\\nto prevent recurrence.\\nCutaneous Abscess\\nA cutaneous abscess is a localized collection of pus in the skin and may occur on any skin\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 81.

Symptoms and signs are pain and a tender, firm or fluctuant swelling. Diagnosis is\\nusually obvious by examination. Treatment is incision and drainage.\\nBacteria causing cutaneous abscesses are typically indigenous to the skin of the involved area. For\\nabscesses on the trunk, extremities, axillae, or head and neck, the most common organisms are\\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n and streptococci. In recent years, methicillin-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n (MRSA) has\\nbecome a more common cause.\\nAbscesses in the perineal (ie, inguinal, vaginal, buttock, perirectal) region contain organisms found in the\\nstool, commonly anaerobes or a combination of aerobes and anaerobes. Carbuncles and furuncles are\\nfollicle-based cutaneous abscesses with characteristic features (see p. \\n697\\n).\\nCutaneous abscesses tend to form in patients with bacterial overgrowth, antecedent trauma (particularly\\nwhen a foreign body is present), or immunologic or circulatory compromise.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nCutaneous abscesses are painful, tender, indurated, and sometimes erythematous. They vary in size,\\ntypically 1 to 3 cm in length, but sometimes much larger. Initially the swelling is firm; later, as the abscess\\n\"points,\" the overlying skin becomes thin and feels fluctuant. \\nThe abscess may then spontaneously drain.\\nLocal cellulitis, lymphangitis, regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and leukocytosis are variable\\naccompanying features.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Examination\\n• Gram stain and culture to identify MRSA\\nDiagnosis is usually obvious by examination. Gram stain and culture are recommended, primarily to\\nidentify MRSA.\\nConditions resembling simple cutaneous abscesses include hidradenitis suppurativa (see p. \\n698\\n) and\\nruptured epidermal cysts. Epidermal cysts (often incorrectly referred to as sebaceous cysts) rarely\\nbecome infected; however, rupture releases keratin into the dermis, causing an exuberant inflammatory\\nreaction sometimes clinically resembling infection. Culture of these ruptured cysts seldom reveals any\\nbacteria. Perineal abscesses may represent cutaneous emergence of a deeper perirectal abscess or\\ndrainage from Crohn\\'s disease via a fistulous tract. These other conditions are usually recognizable by\\nhistory and rectal examination.\\nTreatment\\n• Incision and drainage\\n• Sometimes antibiotics\\nSome small abscesses resolve without treatment, coming to a point and draining. Warm compresses help\\naccelerate the process. Incision and drainage are indicated when significant pain, tenderness, and\\nswelling are present; it is unnecessary to await fluctuance. Under sterile conditions, local anesthesia is\\nadministered as either a lidocaine injection or a freezing spray.\\nPatients with large, extremely painful abscesses may benefit from IV sedation and analgesia during\\ndrainage. A single puncture with the tip of a scalpel is often sufficient to open the abscess. After the pus\\ndrains, the cavity should be bluntly probed with a gloved finger or curette to clear loculations, and then\\nirrigated with 0.9% saline solution. Some clinicians pack the cavity loosely with a gauze wick that is\\nremoved 24 to 48 h later.

Hot tub folliculitis occurs because of inadequate treatment of water\\nwith chlorine or bromine.\\nSymptoms of folliculitis are mild pain, pruritus, or irritation. Signs of folliculitis are a superficial pustule or\\ninflammatory nodule surrounding a hair follicle. Infected hairs easily fall out or are removed, but new\\npapules tend to develop. Growth of stiff hairs into the skin may cause chronic low-grade irritation or\\ninflammation that may mimic infectious folliculitis (pseudofolliculitis barbae—see p. \\n731\\n).\\nTreatment\\nBecause most folliculitis is caused by \\nS. aureus\\n, clindamycin 1% lotion or gel may be applied topically bid\\nfor 7 to 10 days. Alternatively, benzoyl peroxide 5% wash may be used when showering for 5 to 7 days.\\nExtensive cutaneous involvement may warrant systemic therapy (eg, cephalexin 250 to 500 mg po tid to\\nqid for 10 days). If these measures do not result in a cure, or folliculitis recurs, pustules are Gram stained\\nand cultured to rule out gram-negative or methicillin-resistant \\nS. aureus\\n (MRSA) etiology, and nares are\\ncultured to rule out nasal staphylococcal carriage. Potassium hydroxide wet mount should be done on a\\nplucked hair to rule out fungal folliculitis.\\nTreatment for MRSA usually requires 2 oral antibiotics, and the choice of therapeutic drugs should be\\nbased on culture and sensitivity reports.\\nHot tub folliculitis usually resolves without treatment. However, adequate chlorination of the hot tub is\\nnecessary to prevent recurrences and to protect others from infection.\\nFuruncles and Carbuncles\\nFuruncles are skin abscesses caused by staphylococcal infection, which involve a hair follicle\\nand surrounding tissue. Carbuncles are clusters of furuncles connected subcutaneously,\\ncausing deeper suppuration and scarring. They are smaller and more superficial than\\nsubcutaneous abscesses (see p. \\n696\\n). Diagnosis is by appearance. Treatment is warm\\ncompresses and often oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics.\\nBoth furuncles and carbuncles may affect healthy young people but are more common in the obese, the\\nimmunocompromised (including those with neutrophil defects), the elderly, and possibly those with\\ndiabetes. Clustered cases may occur among those living in crowded quarters with relatively poor hygiene\\nor among contacts of patients infected with virulent strains. Predisposing factors include bacterial\\ncolonization of skin or nares, hot and humid climates, and occlusion or abnormal follicular anatomy (eg,\\ncomedones in acne). Methicillin-resistant \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n (MRSA) is a common cause.\\nFuruncles are common on the neck, breasts, face, and buttocks. They are uncomfortable and may be\\npainful when closely attached to underlying structures (eg, on the nose, ear, or fingers). Appearance is a\\nnodule or pustule that discharges necrotic tissue and sanguineous pus. Carbuncles may be accompanied\\nby fever and prostration.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is by examination.

Patients with recurrent furunculosis should be treated for predisposing factors such as obesity,\\ndiabetes, occupational or industrial exposure to inciting factors, and nasal carriage of \\nS. aureus\\n or MRSA\\ncolonization.\\nErythrasma\\nErythrasma is an intertriginous infection with \\nCorynebacterium minutissimum\\n that is most\\ncommon among patients with diabetes and among people living in the tropics.\\nErythrasma resembles tinea or intertrigo. It is most common in the foot, where it manifests as superficial\\nscaling, fissuring, and maceration most commonly confined to the 3rd and 4th web spaces. Erythrasma is\\nalso common in the groin, where it manifests as irregular but sharply marginated pink or brown patches\\nwith fine scaling. Erythrasma may also involve the axillae, submammary or abdominal folds, and\\nperineum, particularly in obese middle-aged women and in patients with diabetes.\\nErythrasma fluoresces a characteristic coral-red color under Wood's light.

Intralesional corticosteroid injections (eg, triamcinolone 1 to 10% suspension intradermally) may\\nhelp with inflammation and pain. Surgical excision and repair or grafting of the affected areas is often\\nnecessary if the disease persists. Ablative laser therapy (CO\\n2\\n or erbium:YAG) is an alternate surgical\\ntreatment.

Most cases respond\\nrapidly to antistreptococcal antibiotics (see \\nCellulitis\\n on p. \\n694\\n).\\nNecrotizing Subcutaneous Infection\\n(Necrotizing Fasciitis)\\nNecrotizing subcutaneous infection (NSI) is typically caused by a mixture of aerobic and\\nanaerobic organisms that cause necrosis of subcutaneous tissue, usually including the fascia.\\nThis infection most commonly affects the extremities and perineum. Affected tissues become\\nred, hot, and swollen, resembling severe cellulitis (see p. \\n694\\n). Without timely treatment, the\\narea becomes gangrenous. Patients are acutely ill. Diagnosis is by history and examination and\\nis supported by evidence of overwhelming infection. Treatment involves antibiotics and\\nsurgical debridement. Prognosis is poor without early, aggressive treatment.\\nEtiology\\nNSI typically results from infection with group A streptococci (eg, \\nStreptococcus pyogenes\\n) or a mixture of\\naerobic and anaerobic bacteria (eg, \\nBacteroides\\n sp). These organisms typically extend to subcutaneous\\ntissue from a contiguous ulcer, an infection, or after trauma. Streptococci can arrive from a remote site of\\ninfection via the bloodstream. Perineal involvement (also called Fournier's gangrene) is usually a\\ncomplication of recent surgery, perirectal abscess, periurethral gland infection, or retroperitoneal infection\\nfrom perforated abdominal viscera. Patients with diabetes are at particular risk of NSI.\\nPathophysiology\\nNSI causes tissue ischemia by widespread occlusion of small subcutaneous vessels. Vessel occlusion\\nresults in skin infarction and necrosis, which facilitates the growth of obligate anaerobes (eg,\\nBacteroides\\n) while promoting anaerobic metabolism by facultative organisms (eg, \\nEscherichia coli\\n),\\nresulting in gangrene. Anaerobic metabolism produces hydrogen and nitrogen, relatively insoluble gases\\nthat may accumulate in subcutaneous tissues.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe primary symptom is intense pain. However, in areas denervated by peripheral neuropathy, pain may\\nbe minimal or absent. Affected tissue is red, hot, and swollen and rapidly becomes discolored. Bullae,\\ncrepitus (from soft-tissue gas), and gangrene may develop. Subcutaneous tissues (including adjacent\\nfascia) necrose, with widespread undermining of surrounding tissue. Muscles are spared initially. Patients\\nare acutely ill, with high fever, tachycardia, altered mental status ranging from confusion to obtundation,\\nand hypotension.

Parasitic Skin Infections\\nIntroduction\\nParasitic skin infections can cause severe itching and be distressing. Most skin parasites are insects or\\nworms that burrow into the skin for part or all of their life cycle. Also, some systemic parasitic infections\\nhave cutaneous manifestations; these include certain nematodes (ancylostomiasis, dracunculosis,\\nstrongyloidiasis, toxocariasis—see p. \\n1342\\n) and flukes (schistosomiasis—see p. \\n1358\\n). Very rarely,\\npatients have delusional parasitosis.\\nCutaneous Larva Migrans\\n(Creeping Eruption)\\nCutaneous larva migrans (CLM) is the skin manifestation of hookworm infestation.\\nCLM is caused by \\nAncylostoma\\n sp, most commonly dog or cat hookworm \\nAncylostoma braziliense\\n.\\nHookworm ova in dog or cat feces develop into infective larvae when left in warm moist ground or sand;\\ntransmission occurs when skin directly contacts contaminated soil or sand and larvae penetrate\\nunprotected skin, usually of the feet, legs, buttocks, or back. CLM occurs worldwide but most commonly\\nin tropical environments.\\nCLM causes intense pruritus; signs are erythema and papules at the site of entry, with a winding,\\nthreadlike subcutaneous trail of reddish-brown inflammation. Diagnosis is by history and clinical\\nappearance.\\nTopical thiabendazole 15% liquid or cream (compounded) bid to tid for 5 days is extremely effective. Oral\\nthiabendazole is not well tolerated and not usually used. Albendazole (400 mg po once/day for 7 days)\\nand ivermectin can cure the infestation and are well tolerated.\\nCLM may be complicated by a self-limiting pulmonary reaction called Loffler's syndrome (patchy\\npulmonary infiltrates and peripheral blood eosinophilia).\\nCutaneous Myiasis\\nCutaneous myiasis is skin infestation by the larvae of certain fly species.\\nMyiasis involves the larvae of two-winged (dipterous) flies. Three types of cutaneous infestation exist,\\ndepending on the species involved:\\n• Furuncular\\n• Wound\\n• Migratory\\nOther organs sometimes are involved (eg, nasopharynx, GI tract, GU tract). Infestation usually occurs in\\ntropical countries, so most cases in the US occur in people who have recently arrived from endemic\\nareas.\\nFuruncular myiasis:\\n Many of the common sources are known as bot flies. \\nDermatobia hominis\\n, native\\nto South and Central America, is the most common cause in travelers returning to the US. Other species\\ninclude \\nCordylobia anthropophaga\\n (in sub-Saharan Africa), and various \\nCuterebra\\n sp (in tropical Africa).\\nMany of the flies do not lay their eggs on humans but on other insects (eg, mosquitoes) or objects (eg,\\ndrying laundry) that may contact skin. Eggs on the skin hatch into larvae, which burrow into the skin and\\ndevelop through successive stages (instars) into mature larvae; mature larvae may be 1 to 2 cm long,\\ndepending on the species.

The initial\\nlesion may resemble an arthropod bite or bacterial furuncle but may be distinguished by the presence of a\\ncentral punctum with serosanguineous drainage; sometimes a small portion of the end of the larva is\\nvisible.\\nBecause larvae require atmospheric O\\n2\\n, occlusion of the skin opening may cause them to depart or at\\nleast come closer to the surface, facilitating manual removal. The numerous occlusal methods include use\\nof petrolatum, nail polish, bacon, or a paste of tobacco. However, larvae that die during occlusion are\\ndifficult to remove and often trigger an intense inflammatory reaction. Other options for removal include\\nmanual expression (ie, squeezing) and extraction through a small incision. Ivermectin, oral (200 \\nμ\\ng/kg,\\none dose) or topical, may kill the larvae or induce migration.\\nWound myiasis:\\n Open wounds, typically in the homeless, alcoholics, and other people in poor social\\ncircumstances, may be infested by fly larvae, most often from green or black blowflies. Unlike larvae of\\ncommon houseflies, most agents of wound myiasis invade healthy as well as necrotic tissue. Treatment is\\nusually with irrigation and manual debridement.\\nMigratory myiasis:\\n The most common agents are \\nGasterophilus intestinalis\\n and \\nHypoderma\\n sp. These\\nflies typically infest horses and cattle; people acquire them via contact with infested animals or, less often,\\nvia direct egg-laying on their skin. Larvae of these agents burrow under the skin, causing pruritic,\\nadvancing lesions, which may be mistaken for cutaneous larva migrans; however, fly larvae are much\\nlarger than nematodes, and the lesions created by fly larvae last longer. Treatment is similar to that of\\nfuruncular myiasis.\\nDelusional Parasitosis\\nIn delusional parasitosis, patients mistakenly believe that they are infested with parasites.\\nPatients have an unshakable belief that they are infested with insects, worms, mites, lice, or other\\norganisms. They often provide vivid descriptions of how the organisms enter their skin and move around\\ntheir bodies, and bring samples of hair, skin, and debris such as dried scabs, dust, and lint on slides or in\\ncontainers (the matchbox sign) to prove that the infestation is real. The condition is considered a\\nhypochondriacal psychosis, but the cause is unknown.\\nDiagnosis is suspected by history. Work-up requires ruling out true infestations and other physiologic\\ndisease by physical examination and judicious testing, such as skin scrapings and CBC.\\nTreatment is with antipsychotic drugs (see p. \\n1562\\n). Typically, the patient seeks confirmation that the drug\\ntreats the infestation itself, and any suggestion that the treatment is for something else is met with\\nresistance and/or rejection. Thus, effective treatment often requires diplomacy and a delicate balance\\nbetween offering proper treatment and respecting the patient's right to know.\\nLice\\n(Pediculosis)\\nLice can infect the scalp, body, pubis, and eyelashes. Head lice are transmitted by close\\ncontact; body lice, in cramped, crowded conditions; and pubic lice, by sexual contact.\\nSymptoms, signs, diagnosis, and treatment differ by location of infestation.\\nLice are wingless, blood-sucking insects that infest the head (\\nPediculus humanus\\n var. \\ncapitis\\n), body (\\nP.\\nhumanus\\n var. \\ncorporis\\n), or pubis (\\nPhthirus pubis\\n).

Scabies is easily transmitted from person to person through\\nphysical contact; animal and fomite transmission probably also occurs. The primary risk factor is crowded\\nconditions (as in schools, shelters, barracks, and some households); there is no clear association with\\npoor hygiene. For unknown reasons, crusted scabies is more common in immunosuppressed patients\\n(eg, those with HIV infection, hematologic cancer, chronic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressant\\nuse), patients with severe physical disabilities or intellectual disability, and Australian Aborigines.\\nInfestations occur worldwide. Patients in warm climates develop small \\nerythematous papules with few\\nburrows. Severity is related to the patient's immune status, not geography.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nThe primary symptom is intense pruritus, classically worse at night, although that timing is not specific to\\nscabies.\\nClassic scabies:\\n Erythematous papules initially appear in finger web spaces, flexor surfaces of the wrist\\nand elbow, axillary folds, along the belt line, or on the lower buttocks. Papules can spread to any area of\\nthe body, including the breasts and penis. The face remains uninvolved in adults. Burrows are\\npathognomonic for disease, manifesting as fine, wavy, and slightly scaly lines several mm to 1 cm long. A\\ntiny dark papule—the mite—is often visible at one end.\\nSigns of classic scabies may be atypical. In blacks and other people with dark skin, scabies can manifest\\nas granulomatous nodules. In infants, the palms, soles, face, and scalp may be involved, especially in the\\nposterior auricular folds. In elderly patients, scabies can cause intense pruritus with subtle skin findings,\\nmaking it a challenge to diagnose. In immunocompromised patients, there may be widespread nonpruritic\\nscaling (particularly on the palms and soles in adults and on the scalp in children).\\nOther forms:\\n Crusted (Norwegian) scabies is due to an impaired host immune response, allowing mites\\nto proliferate and number in the millions. Nodular scabies is more common in infants and young children\\nand may be due to hypersensitivity to retained organisms. Bullous scabies occurs more commonly in\\nchildren. When it occurs in the elderly, it can mimic bullous pemphigoid, resulting in a delay in diagnosis.\\nScalp scabies occurs in infants and immunocompromised people and can mimic dermatitis, particularly\\natopic or seborrheic dermatitis. Scabies incognito is a widespread atypical form resulting from application\\nof topical corticosteroids.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Burrow scrapings\\nDiagnosis is suspected by physical findings, especially burrows, and confirmed by mites, ova, or fecal\\npellets on microscopic examination of burrow scrapings.

Viral Skin Diseases\\nIntroduction\\nMany systemic viral infections cause skin lesions. Molluscum contagiosum and warts are the 2 most\\ncommon primary viral skin diseases without systemic manifestations. Herpes simplex virus infection is\\ndiscussed on p. \\n1417\\n.\\nMolluscum Contagiosum\\nMolluscum contagiosum is clusters of smooth, waxy, or pearly umbilicated papules 1 to 5 mm in\\ndiameter caused by molluscum contagiosum virus, a poxvirus.\\nMolluscum contagiosum virus commonly causes a localized chronic infection. Transmission is by direct\\ncontact; spread occurs by autoinoculation and via fomites (eg, towels, bath sponges).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nMolluscum contagiosum can appear anywhere on the skin except the palms and soles. Lesions consist of\\nclusters of flesh-colored papules, which occur most commonly on the face, trunk, and extremities in\\nchildren and on the pubis, penis, or vulva in adults. Lesions may grow to 10 to 15 mm in diameter,\\nespecially among patients with HIV infection and other immunocompromised patients. Lesions are usually\\nnot pruritic or painful and may be discovered only coincidentally during a physical examination. However,\\nthe lesions can become inflamed and itchy as the body fights off the virus.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\nDiagnosis is based on clinical appearance; hematoxylin and eosin staining of expressed fluid\\ndemonstrates inclusion bodies but is necessary only when diagnosis is uncertain. Differential diagnosis\\nincludes folliculitis, milia, and warts (for lesions < 2 mm) and juvenile xanthogranuloma and Spitz nevus\\n(for lesions > 2 mm).\\nTreatment\\n• Curettage, cryosurgery, laser therapy, or electrocautery\\n• Topical irritants (eg, trichloroacetic acid, cantharidin, tretinoin, tazarotene), imiquimod, or both\\n• Sometimes combination therapies\\nMost lesions spontaneously regress in 1 to 2 yr, but they can remain for 2 to 3 yr. Treatment is indicated\\nfor cosmetic reasons or for prevention of sexual spread. Options include curettage, cryosurgery, laser\\ntherapy, electrocautery, trichloroacetic acid (25 to 40% solution), cantharidin, tretinoin, tazarotene and\\nimiquimod 5% cream. Especially in children, treatments that cause minimal pain (eg, tretinoin, imiquimod,\\ntazarotene, cantharidin) are used first. Curettage or liquid nitrogen can be used after application of a\\ntopical anesthetic such as EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) or 4% lidocaine cream. EMLA\\ncream must be applied judiciously because it can cause systemic toxicity, especially in children. In adults,\\ncurettage is very effective but painful. Dermatologists often use combination therapy such as liquid\\nnitrogen or cantharidin in the office and imiquimod cream at home. This form of therapy is typically\\nsuccessful, but resolution often takes 1 to 2 mo in some patients.\\nNondermatologists should feel comfortable using imiquimod cream. The cream is applied at night, 1 drop\\nto each molluscum lesion and rubbed in well, until the cream turns clear. The area is washed with soap\\nand water. The cream can be applied 3 to 7 times/wk. Molluscum lesions within the orbital rim should not\\nbe treated, and those in the genital region can easily become irritated. Lesions should be treated until\\nthey develop a scant amount of redness; treatment is then withheld to avoid weeping and crusting.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 84.

Diagnosis is by examination.\\nWarts are usually self limited but may be treated by excision, cautery, cryotherapy, liquid\\nnitrogen, and topical or injected agents.\\nWarts are almost universal in the population; they affect all ages but are most common among children\\nand are uncommon among the elderly.\\nEtiology\\nWarts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; there are over 100 HPV subtypes. Trauma\\nand maceration facilitate initial epidermal inoculation. Spread may then occur by autoinoculation. Local\\nand systemic immune factors appear to influence spread; immunosuppressed patients (especially those\\nwith HIV infection or a renal transplant) are at particular risk of developing generalized lesions that are\\ndifficult to treat. Humoral immunity provides resistance to HPV infection; cellular immunity helps\\nestablished infection to regress.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nWarts are named by their clinical appearance and location; different forms are linked to different HPV\\ntypes (for unusual manifestations, see\\nTable 84-1\\n).\\nCommon warts:\\n Common warts (verrucae vulgaris) are caused by HPV 1, 2, 4, 27, and 29. They are\\nusually asymptomatic but sometimes cause mild pain, especially when they are located on a weight-\\nbearing surface (eg, bottom of the feet). They are sharply demarcated, rough, round or irregular, firm, and\\nlight gray, yellow, brown, or gray-black nodules 2 to 10 mm in diameter. They appear most often on sites\\nsubject to trauma (eg, fingers, elbows, knees, face) but may spread elsewhere. Variants of unusual shape\\n(eg, pedunculated or resembling a cauliflower) appear most frequently on the head and neck, especially\\nthe scalp and beard area.\\nFiliform warts:\\n These warts are long, narrow, frondlike growths, usually located on the eyelids, face,\\nneck, or lips. They are usually asymptomatic. This morphologically distinct variant of the common wart is\\nbenign and easy to treat.\\nFlat warts:\\n Flat warts, caused by HPV 3, 10, 28, and 49, are smooth, flat-topped, yellow-brown papules,\\nmost often located on the face and along scratch marks; they are more common among children and\\nyoung adults and develop by autoinoculation. They generally cause no symptoms but can be difficult to\\ntreat.\\nPalmar and plantar warts:\\n These warts, caused by HPV 1, occur on the palms and soles; they are\\nflattened by pressure and surrounded by cornified epithelium (see\\nPlate 55\\n).

Infection with high-risk HPV types (most\\nnotably types 16 and 18) is the main cause of cervical cancer. These warts are usually asymptomatic.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Clinical evaluation\\n• Rarely biopsy\\nDiagnosis is based on clinical appearance; biopsy is rarely needed. A cardinal sign of warts is the\\nabsence of skin lines crossing their surface and the presence of pinpoint black dots (thrombosed\\ncapillaries) or bleeding when warts are shaved. Differential diagnosis includes corns (clavi), lichen\\nplanus, seborrheic keratosis, skin tags, and squamous cell carcinomas. DNA typing is available in some\\nmedical centers but is generally not needed.\\nPrognosis\\nMany warts regress spontaneously; others persist for years and recur at the same or different sites, even\\nwith treatment. Factors influencing recurrence appear to be related to the patient's overall immune status\\nas well as local factors. Patients who subject themselves to local trauma (eg, athletes, mechanics,\\nbutchers) may have recalcitrant and recurrent HPV infection. Genital HPV infection has malignant\\npotential, but malignant transformation is rare in HPV-induced skin warts, except among\\nimmunosuppressed patients.\\nTreatment\\n• Topical irritants (eg, salicylic acid, cantharidin, podophyllum resin)\\n• Destructive methods (eg, cryosurgery, electrocautery, curettage, excision, laser)\\nTreatment is aimed at eliciting an immune response to HPV. In most instances, this response is achieved\\nby applying an irritant (eg, salicylic acid [SCA], trichloroacetic acid, 5-fluorouracil, podophyllum resin,\\ntretinoin, cantharidin).\\nThese compounds can be used in combination or with a destructive method (eg, cryosurgery,\\nelectrocautery, curettage, excision, laser). Direct antiviral effects can be achieved with bleomycin and\\ninterferon alfa-2b, but these treatments are reserved for the most recalcitrant warts.

SCA is available in a liquid, plaster, or impregnated\\nwithin tape.

There are 4 main genetic\\nforms:\\n• Type I is caused by absent (OCA1A; 40% of all OCA) or reduced (OCA1B) tyrosinase activity;\\ntyrosinase catalyzes several steps in melanin synthesis.\\n• Type II (50% of all OCA) is caused by mutations in the P (pink-eyed) gene. The function of the P protein\\nis not yet known. Tyrosinase activity is present.\\n• Type III occurs only in people with dark skin (skin types III to V).

It is both familial (autosomal dominant,\\nwith incomplete penetrance and variable expression) and acquired. Proposed mechanisms include\\nautoimmune destruction of melanocytes, reduced survival of melanocytes, and primary melanocyte\\ndefects. Occasionally, vitiligo occurs after a direct physical injury to the skin (eg, as a response to\\nsunburn). This form of vitiligo is called the Koebner phenomenon. Patients may associate the onset of\\nvitiligo with emotional stress.\\nSome patients have antibodies to melanin. Up to 30% have other autoimmune antibodies (to\\nthyroglobulin, adrenal cells, and parietal cells) or clinical autoimmune endocrinopathies (Addison's\\ndisease, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia, and thyroid dysfunction), leading to speculation that vitiligo\\nis an autoimmune disease. However, the relationship is unclear and may be coincidental. The strongest\\nassociation is with hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) and hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis).\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nVitiligo is characterized by depigmented areas (see\\nPlate 54\\n), usually sharply demarcated and often symmetric. Depigmentation may be localized, involving 1\\nor 2 spots or entire body segments (segmental vitiligo); rarely, it may be generalized, involving most of the\\nskin surface (universal vitiligo).

This treatment can be extremely irritating, so a smaller\\ntest area should be treated before widespread use. Treatment for ≥ 1 yr may be required.\\nHyperpigmentation\\nHyperpigmentation has multiple causes and may be focal or diffuse. Most cases are due to an increase in\\nmelanin production and deposition.\\nFocal hyperpigmentation is most often postinflammatory in nature, occurring after injury (eg, cuts and\\nburns) or other causes of inflammation (eg, acne, lupus). Focal linear hyperpigmentation is commonly due\\nto phytophotodermatitis, which results from ultraviolet light combined with furocoumarins in limes, celery,\\nand other plants.\\nHyperpigmentation also has systemic and neoplastic causes.\\nMelasma (chloasma):\\n Melasma consists of dark brown, sharply marginated, roughly symmetric patches\\nof hyperpigmentation on the face (usually on the forehead, temples, and cheeks). It occurs primarily in\\npregnant women (melasma gravidarum, or the mask of pregnancy) and in women taking oral\\ncontraceptives. Ten percent of cases occur in nonpregnant women and dark-skinned men. Melasma is\\nmore prevalent and lasts longer in people with dark skin.\\nBecause all cases are associated with sun exposure, the mechanism probably involves overproduction of\\nmelanin by hyperfunctional melanocytes. Other than sun exposure, aggravating factors include\\n• Autoimmune thyroid disorders\\n• Photosensitizing drugs\\nIn women, melasma fades slowly and incompletely after childbirth or cessation of hormone use. In men,\\nmelasma rarely fades.\\nTreatment depends on whether the pigmentation is epidermal or dermal; epidermal pigmentation becomes\\naccentuated with Wood's light or can be diagnosed with biopsy. Only epidermal pigmentation responds to\\ntreatment. First-line therapy includes a combination of hydroquinone 2 to 4%, tretinoin 0.05 to 1%, and a\\nclass V to VII topical corticosteroid. Hydroquinone 3 to 4% applied twice daily is often effective, but long\\ncourses are usually required; 2% hydroquinone is useful as maintenance. Hydroquinone should be tested\\nbehind one ear or on a small patch on the forearm for 1 wk before use on the face because it may cause\\nirritation. Bleaching agents, such as 0.1% tretinoin and azelaic acid 15 to 20% cream, can be used in\\nplace of or with hydroquinone. Chemical peeling with glycolic acid or 30 to 50% trichloroacetic acid is an\\noption for patients with severe melasma unresponsive to topical bleaching agents.\\nLentigines:\\n Lentigines (singular: lentigo) are flat, tan to brown oval spots. They are commonly due to\\nchronic sun exposure (solar lentigines; sometimes called liver spots) and occur most frequently on the\\nface and back of the hands. They typically first appear during middle age and increase in number with\\nage. Although progression from lentigines to melanoma has not been established, lentigines are an\\nindependent risk factor for melanoma. They are treated with cryotherapy or laser; hydroquinone is not\\neffective.\\nNonsolar lentigines are sometimes associated with systemic disorders, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome\\n(in which profuse lentigines of the lips occur), multiple lentigines syndrome (Leopard syndrome), or\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 85.

Hair Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nHair growth in both men and women is regulated by androgens. Testosterone stimulates hair growth in\\nthe pubic area and underarms. Dihydrotestosterone stimulates beard hair growth and scalp hair loss.\\nHair disorders include alopecia, hypertrichosis, hirsutism, and pseudofolliculitis barbae. Although most\\nhair disorders are not serious, they are often perceived as major cosmetic issues that demand treatment.\\nDandruff is not a hair disorder but rather a skin disorder (seborrheic dermatitis) of the scalp (see p. \\n671\\n).\\nAlopecia\\n(Baldness)\\nAlopecia is defined as loss of hair. Hair loss is often a cause of great concern to the patient for cosmetic\\nand psychologic reasons, but it can also be an important sign of systemic disease.\\nPathophysiology\\nGrowth cycle:\\n Hair grows in cycles. Each cycle consists of a long growing phase (anagen), a brief\\ntransitional apoptotic phase (catagen), and a short resting phase (telogen). At the end of the resting\\nphase, the hair falls out (exogen) and a new hair starts growing in the follicle, beginning the cycle again.\\nNormally, about 100 scalp hairs reach the end of resting phase each day and fall out. When significantly\\nmore than 100 hairs/day go into resting phase, clinical hair loss (telogen effluvium) may occur. A\\ndisruption of the growing phase causing abnormal loss of anagen hairs is an anagen effluvium.\\nClassification:\\n Alopecia can be classified as focal or diffuse and by the presence or absence of scarring.\\nScarring alopecia is the result of active destruction of the hair follicle. The follicle is irreparably damaged\\nand replaced by fibrotic tissue. Several hair disorders show a biphasic pattern in which nonscarring\\nalopecia occurs early in the course of the disease, and then permanent hair loss occurs as the disease\\nprogresses. Scarring alopecias can be subdivided further into primary forms, where the target of\\ninflammation is the follicle itself, and secondary forms, where the follicle is destroyed as a result of\\nnonspecific inflammation (see\\nTable 86-1\\n).\\nNonscarring alopecia results from processes that reduce or slow hair growth without irreparably\\ndamaging the hair follicle. Disorders that primarily affect the hair shaft also are considered nonscarring\\nalopecia.\\nEtiology\\nThe alopecias comprise a large group of disorders with multiple and varying etiologies (see \\nTable 86-1\\n).\\nThe \\nmost common cause\\n of alopecia is\\n• Androgenetic alopecia (male-pattern or female-pattern hair loss)\\nAndrogenetic alopecia is an androgen-dependent hereditary disorder in which dihydrotestosterone plays\\na major role.\\nOther common causes\\n of hair loss are\\n• Drugs (including chemotherapeutic agents)\\n• Infection\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 86.

When it occurs in young men with\\nno family history, the physician should question the patient about use of anabolic steroids and other\\ndrugs.

Gentle traction is exerted on a bunch of hairs (40 to\\n60) on at least 3 different areas of the scalp, and the number of extracted hairs is counted and examined\\nmicroscopically. Normally, < 3 telogen-phase hairs should come out with each pull. If at least 3 hairs are\\nobtained with each pull or if > 10 hairs total are obtained, the pull test is positive and suggestive of\\ntelogen effluvium.\\nThe \\npluck test\\n pulls individual hairs out abruptly (\"by the roots\"). The roots of the plucked hairs are\\nexamined microscopically to determine the phase of growth and thus help diagnose a defect of telogen or\\nanagen or an occult systemic disease. Anagen hairs have sheaths attached to their roots; telogen hairs\\nhave tiny bulbs without sheaths at their roots. Normally, 85 to 90% of hairs are in the\\n[\\nFig. 86-1.\\n Male-pattern and female-pattern hair loss.]\\nanagen phase; about 10 to 15% are in telogen phase; and < 1% are in catagen phase.

Topical\\nminoxidil 1 mL bid applied to the scalp is most effective for vertex alopecia in male-pattern or female-\\npattern hair loss. However, usually only 30 to 40% of patients experience significant hair growth, and\\nminoxidil is generally not effective or indicated for other causes of hair loss except possibly alopecia\\nareata.

Nail Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nA variety of disorders can affect nails, including deformities, infections of the nail, paronychia, and\\ningrown toenails. Nail changes may occur in many systemic conditions and genetic syndromes.\\nNails may also undergo changes due to local infection or trauma. For example, trauma to the finger may\\ncause changes in the nail. The nail may develop a white coloration that starts at the nail bed and grows\\nup with the nail. Sometimes, if a nail becomes separated from the nail bed, a new nail grows below the\\nexisting nail and replaces it when fully grown in.\\nMost nail infections are fungal (onychomycosis—see p. \\n734\\n), but bacterial and viral infections can occur\\n(eg, green-nail syndrome [\\nPseudomonas\\n], herpetic whitlow [herpes simplex virus-1]). Paronychia is not\\nactually an infection of the nail but rather of periungual tissues.\\nCommon warts (verrucae vulgaris) result from papillomavirus infection and frequently infect the proximal\\nnail fold and sometimes the subungual area. Onychophagia (nail-biting) can help to spread this infection.\\nWarts involving these areas are especially difficult to treat. Freezing with liquid nitrogen may be effective.\\nToenails require special attention in the elderly and in people with diabetes or peripheral vascular\\ndisease; a podiatrist can help avoid local breakdown and secondary infections.\\nDeformities\\nAbout 50% of nail deformities result from fungal infection. The remainder result from various causes,\\nincluding trauma, psoriasis, lichen planus, and occasionally cancer. Diagnosis may be obvious on\\nexamination, but sometimes fungal scrapings and culture may be done. Deformities may resolve with\\ntreatment of the cause, but if not, manicurists may be able to hide nail deformities with appropriate\\ntrimming and polishes. Dystrophies are often considered together with deformities, but the two are slightly\\ndifferent; deformities are generally considered to be gross changes in nail shape, whereas dystrophies\\nare changes in nail texture or composition (eg, onychomycosis).\\nCongenital deformities:\\n In some congenital ectodermal dysplasias, patients have no nails (anonychia).\\nIn pachyonychia congenita, the nail beds are thickened, discolored, and hypercurved with a pincer nail\\ndeformity. Nail-patella syndrome (see p. \\n2910\\n) causes triangular lunulae and partially absent thumb nails.\\nPatients with Darier's disease can have nails with red and white streaks and a distal V-shaped nick.\\nDeformities associated with systemic problems:\\n In Plummer-Vinson syndrome, 50% of patients have\\nkoilonychia (concave, spoon-shaped nails). Yellow nail syndrome (characterized by hard, hypercurved,\\ntransversely thickened, yellow nails with loss of the cuticle) occurs in patients with lymphedema of limbs,\\npleural effusion, and ascites. Half-and-half nails occur with renal failure; the proximal half of the nail is\\nwhite, and the distal half is pink or pigmented. White nails occur with cirrhosis, although the distal third\\nmay remain pinker.\\nDeformities associated with dermatologic conditions:\\n In psoriasis, nails may have a number of\\nchanges, including irregular pits, oil spots (localized areas of tan-brown discoloration), onycholysis, and\\nthickening and crumbling of the nail plate. Lichen planus of the nail matrix causes scarring with early\\nlongitudinal ridging and splitting of the nail and later leads to pterygium formation. Pterygium of the nail is\\ncharacterized by scarring from the proximal nail outward in a V formation, which leads ultimately to loss of\\nthe nail. Alopecia areata can be accompanied by regular pits that form a pattern.\\nDiscoloration:\\n Cancer chemotherapy drugs (especially the taxanes) can cause melanonychia (nail plate\\npigmentation), which can be diffuse or may occur in transverse bands. Some drugs cause characteristic\\nchanges in nail coloration. For example, quinacrine can \\ncause nails to appear greenish yellow or white\\nunder ultraviolet light. Cyclophosphamide can cause the onychodermal bands (seal formed at the junction\\nof the nail plate and distal nail bed at the free edge of the nail plate) to become slate-gray or bluish.

In argyria, the nails may\\nbe diffusely blue-gray.\\nWhite transverse lines of the nails (Mees' lines) may occur with chemotherapy, acute arsenic intoxication,\\nmalignant tumors, MI, thallium and antimony intoxication, fluorosis, and even during etretinate therapy.\\nThey also develop with trauma to the finger, although traumatic white lines usually do not span the entire\\nnail. The fungus \\nTrichophyton mentagrophytes\\n causes a chalky white discoloration of the nail plate.\\nGreen-nail syndrome is caused by infection with \\nPseudomonas\\n. It is generally a harmless infection,\\nusually of 1 or 2 nails, and is noteworthy for its striking blue-green color. It often occurs in patients with\\nonycholysis or chronic paronychia whose nails have been immersed in fresh water for a long period.\\nTreatment is most effective with soaks of 1% acetic acid solution or alcohol diluted 1:4 with water.\\nPatients should soak their affected nails twice a day for 10 min and should avoid trauma and excess\\nmoisture. Frequent clipping of the nail increases the response to treatment.\\nMelanonychia striata:\\n Melanonychia striata are hyperpigmented bands that are longitudinal and extend\\nfrom the proximal nail fold and cuticle to the free distal end of the nail plate. In dark-skinned people, these\\nbands may be a normal physiologic variant requiring no treatment. Other causes include trauma;\\npregnancy; Addison's disease; post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation; and the use of certain drugs,\\nincluding doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, zidovudine (AZT), and psoralens. Melanonychia striata can also\\noccur in benign melanocytic nevi and malignant melanoma. Hutchinson's sign of the nail (melanin\\nextending through the lunula, cuticle, and proximal nail fold) may signal a melanoma in the nail matrix.\\nRapid biopsy and treatment are essential.\\nOnychogryphosis:\\n Onychogryphosis is a nail dystrophy in which the nail, most often on the big toe,\\nbecomes thickened and curved. It may be caused by ill-fitting shoes. It is common among the elderly.\\nTreatment consists of trimming the deformed nails.\\nOnycholysis:\\n Onycholysis is separation of the nail plate from the nail bed or complete nail plate loss. It\\ncan occur as a drug reaction in patients treated with tetracyclines (photo-onycholysis), doxorubicin, 5-\\nfluorouracil, cardiovascular drugs (particularly practolol and captopril), cloxacillin and cephaloridine\\n(rarely), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, diflunisal, etretinate, indomethacin, isoniazid, and isotretinoin.\\nPartial onycholysis may also result from infection with \\nCandida albicans\\n as a component of\\nonychomycosis or from trauma. Partial onycholysis may occur in patients with psoriasis or thyrotoxicosis.\\nOnychotillomania:\\n In this disorder, patients pick at and self-mutilate their nails, which can lead to\\nparallel transverse grooves and ridges (washboard deformity or habit-tic nails). It most commonly\\nmanifests in patients who habitually push back the cuticle on one finger, causing dystrophy of the nail\\nplate as it grows. Subungual hemorrhages can also develop in onychotillomania.\\nPincer nail deformity:\\n Pincer nail deformity is a transverse over-curvature of the nail plate. It can occur\\nin patients with psoriasis, SLE, Kawasaki disease, cancer, end-stage renal disease, and some genetic\\nsyndromes. Patients often have pain at the borders of the nail where the nail plate curves into the tips of\\nthe fingers.\\nSubungual hematoma and nail bed trauma:\\n Subungual hematoma occurs when blood becomes\\ntrapped between the nail plate and nail bed, usually as a result of trauma. Subungual hematoma causes\\nsignificant pain and eventual separation of and temporary loss of the nail plate. When the cause is a\\ncrush injury, underlying fracture and nail bed damage are common. Nail bed damage may result in\\npermanent nail deformity.\\nIf the injury is acute, nail trephination (eg, creating a hole in the nail plate using a cautery device, 18-\\ngauge needle, or red-hot paperclip) can help relieve pain by draining accumulated blood. It is not clear\\nwhether removing the nail and repairing any nail bed damage reduces risk of permanent nail deformity.\\nTrachyonychia:\\n Trachyonychia (rough, opaque nails) may occur with alopecia areata, lichen planus,\\natopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. It is most common among children.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 87. Nail Disorders\\n856\"),\n",

Differentiation\\nfrom psoriasis or lichen planus is important, because the therapies differ, so diagnosis is typically\\nconfirmed by microscopic examination and culture of scrapings. Scrapings are taken from the most\\nproximal position that can be accessed on the affected nail and are examined for hyphae on potassium\\nhydroxide wet mount and cultured. Obtaining an adequate sample of nail can be difficult because the\\ndistal subungual debris, which is easy to sample, often does not contain living fungus. Therefore,\\nremoving the distal portion of the nail with clippers before sampling or using a small curette to reach more\\nproximally beneath the nail increases the yield. PCR can also be done on nail clippings if cultures are\\nnegative and the cost of finding a definitive diagnosis is warranted.\\nTreatment\\n• Sometimes oral terbinafine or itraconazole\\nOnychomycosis is not always treated because many cases are asymptomatic or mild and unlikely to\\ncause complications, and the oral drugs that are the most effective treatments can potentially cause\\nhepatotoxicity and serious drug interactions. Some proposed indications for treatment include the\\nfollowing:\\n• Previous ipsilateral cellulitis\\n• Diabetes or other risk factors for cellulitis\\n• Presence of bothersome symptoms\\n• Psychosocial impact\\n• Desire for cosmetic improvement (controversial)\\nTreatment is oral terbinafine or itraconazole.

These conditions include squamous\\ncell carcinoma, proximal onychomycosis, pyogenic granuloma, pyoderma gangrenosum, and herpetic\\nwhitlow.\\nTreatment\\n• Antistaphylococcal antibiotics\\n• Drainage of pus\\nEarly treatment is warm compresses or soaks and an antistaphylococcal antibiotic (eg, dicloxacillin or\\ncephalexin 250 mg po qid, clindamycin 300 mg po qid).

Pressure Ulcers\\nIntroduction\\n(Pressure Sores; Bedsores; Decubitus Ulcers; Decubiti)\\nPressure ulcers (PUs) are areas of necrosis and ulceration where tissues are compressed\\nbetween bony prominences and hard surfaces; they result from pressure alone or pressure in\\ncombination with friction, shearing forces, or both. Risk factors include old age, impaired\\ncirculation, immobilization, undernutrition, and incontinence. Severity ranges from\\nnonblanchable skin erythema to full-thickness skin loss with extensive soft-tissue necrosis.\\nDiagnosis is clinical. Prognosis is excellent for early-stage ulcers; neglected and late-stage\\nulcers pose risk of serious infection and nutritional stress and are difficult to heal. Treatment\\nincludes pressure reduction, avoidance of friction and shearing forces, local care, and\\nsometimes skin grafts or myocutaneous flaps.\\nEtiology\\nAn estimated 1.3 to 3 million patients in the US have PUs; incidence is highest in older patients,\\nespecially those who are hospitalized or in long-term care facilities. Aging increases risk, in part because\\nof reduced subcutaneous fat and decreased capillary blood flow. Immobility and comorbidities increase\\nrisk further.\\nPatients who are cognitively impaired, immobile, or both are at increased risk. Immobility—because of\\ndecreased spontaneous movement (eg, due to stroke, sedation, or severe illness) or inability to change\\nposition frequently because of weakness—is the most important factor. Other risk factors include urinary\\nand fecal incontinence; poor nutritional status, including dehydration; diabetes; and cardiovascular\\ndisease. Clinical assessment is sufficient to identify patients at risk; several scales (eg, Norton, Braden\\n—see\\nFig. 88-1\\n) are useful for predicting risk. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel has also issued\\nguidelines for the prediction and prevention of PUs.\\nPathophysiology\\nPUs develop when soft tissues are compressed between bony prominences and contact surfaces\\n[\\nFig. 88-1.\\n Braden scale for predicting risk for pressure ulcers.]\\n[\\nTable 88-1.\\n Pressure Ulcer Staging]\\nor when friction (eg, rubbing against clothing or bedding) or shearing forces (which develop when skin\\nclings to surfaces) cause erosion, tissue ischemia, and infarction. PUs most frequently develop over the\\nsacrum, ischial tuberosities, trochanters, malleoli, and heels, but they can develop elsewhere, including\\nbehind the ears when nasal cannulae are used for prolonged periods. Also, poorly fitting prosthetic\\ndevices can cause PUs to develop over bony prominences. Increased force and duration of pressure\\ndirectly influence risk and severity, but PUs can develop in as little as 3 to 4 h in some settings (eg,\\ntrauma patients who are immobilized on rigid spine-immobilization boards). Ulcers worsen when skin is\\noverly moist and macerated (eg, from perspiration or incontinence).\\nOther causes of skin ulcers:\\n Chronic arterial and venous insufficiency can result in skin ulcers,\\nparticularly on the lower extremities. Although the underlying mechanism is vascular, the same forces that\\ncause PUs can worsen these ulcers, and principles of treatment are similar.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSeveral staging systems exist; the most common classifies ulcers according to the depth of soft-tissue\\ndamage (see \\nTable 88-1\\n). PUs do not always present as Stage I and then progress to higher stages.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 88. Pressure Ulcers\\n861'),\n",

The ulcers are shallow with a\\nreddish base. Intact or partially ruptured blisters due to pressure are also stage II PUs. (NOTE: Non-\\npressure-related causes of erosion, ulceration, or blistering—eg, skin tears, tape burns, perineal\\ndermatitis, maceration, excoriation—are excluded from stage II description.)\\nStages III and IV\\n PUs have deeper involvement of underlying tissue with more extensive destruction.\\nUlcers covered with debris or eschar are by definition unstageable.

A scalpel or scissors can be used to\\nremove eschar (except in heel ulcers, in which dry eschar in the absence of edema, erythema,\\nfluctuance, or drainage can be safely left alone) or extensive areas of dead tissue. Modest amounts of\\neschar or tissue can be debrided at the patient's bedside, but extensive or deep areas should be\\ndebrided in the operating room. Urgent debridement is indicated in advancing cellulitis or sepsis.\\nDebridement with wet-to-dry dressings should be done only for wounds with very loose exudate and\\nonly with great care because it is often painful and it may remove healthy tissue or overdry the wound.\\n• Enzymatic debridement (using collagenase, papain, fibrinolysin, or streptokinase/streptodornase): This\\nmethod can be used for patients whose caretakers are not trained to do mechanical debridement or for\\npatients unable to tolerate surgery.

Transparent films (eg,\\nOpSite, Tegaderm, Bioclusive) are sufficient for ulcers with limited exudate; they should not be used over\\ncavities and must be changed every 3 to 7 days. Some experts recommend a small amount of triple\\nantibiotic ointment under the dressing. Hydrogels (Clear-Site, Vigilon, FlexiGel), which are cross-linked\\npolymer dressings that come in sheets or gels, are indicated for very shallow wounds, such as re-\\nepithelializing wounds with minimal exudate.\\nHydrocolloids (eg, RepliCare, DuoDERM, Restore, Tegasorb), which combine gelatin, pectin, and\\ncarboxymethylcellulose in the form of wafers, powders, and pastes, are indicated for light-to-moderate\\nexudate; some have adhesive backings and others are typically covered with transparent films to ensure\\nadherence to the ulcer and must be changed every 3 days. Alginates (polysaccharide seaweed\\nderivatives containing alginic acid), which come as pads, ropes, and ribbons (AlgiSite, Sorbsan,\\nCurasorb), are indicated for absorbing extensive exudate and for controlling bleeding after surgical\\ndebridement. Foam dressings (Allevyn, LYOfoam, Hydrasorb, Mepilex, Curafoam, Contreet) are useful as\\nthey can handle various levels of exudate and provide a moist environment for wound healing.\\nWaterproof versions protect the skin from incontinence.

Milia are minute superficial keratinous cysts noted on the face.\\nTreatment\\nCysts may be left or removed. A small incision may be made to evacuate the contents, then the cyst wall\\nitself should be removed with a curet or hemostat; otherwise, the lesion will recur.

Skin cancers may also\\ndevelop years after therapeutic x-rays or exposure to carcinogens (eg, arsenic ingestion).\\nOver one million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the US yearly. About 80% are basal cell\\ncarcinoma, 16% are squamous cell carcinoma, and 4% are melanoma. Paget's disease of the nipple or\\nextramammary Paget's (usually near the anus), Kaposi's sarcoma, tumors of adnexa, and cutaneous T-\\ncell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides—see p. \\n1024\\n) make up the remaining, less common, forms of skin\\ncancer.\\nInitially, skin cancers are often asymptomatic. The most frequent presentation is a papule or blind pimple\\nthat does not go away. Any lesion that appears to be enlarging should be biopsied—whether tenderness,\\nmild inflammation, crusting, or occasional bleeding is present or not. If treated early, most skin cancers\\nare curable.\\nScreening:\\n Routine screening for skin cancer is by patient self-examination, physician examination, or\\nboth.\\nPrevention:\\n Because many skin cancers seem to be related to ultraviolet (UV) exposure, a number of\\nmeasures are recommended to limit exposure.\\n• Sun avoidance: Seeking shade, minimizing outdoor activities between 10 AM and 4 PM (when sun's\\nrays are strongest), and avoiding sunbathing and the use of tanning beds\\n• Use of protective clothing: Long-sleeved shirt, pants, and broad-brimmed hat\\n• Use of sunscreen: At least sun protection factor (SPF) 30 with UVA protection, used as directed; should\\nnot be used to prolong sun exposure\\nCurrent evidence is inadequate to determine whether these measures reduce incidence or mortality of\\nmelanoma; in nonmelanoma skin cancers (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma), sun protection does\\ndecrease the incidence of new cancers.\\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\\n(Rodent Ulcer)\\nBasal cell carcinoma is a superficial, slowly growing papule or nodule (see\\nPlate 29\\n) that derives from certain epidermal cells.

If doubt exists, biopsy should include the\\nfull depth of the dermis and extend slightly beyond the edges of the lesion. Biopsy should be excisional\\nfor small lesions and incisional for larger lesions. By doing step sections, the pathologist can determine\\nthe maximal thickness of the melanoma. Definitive radical surgery should not precede histologic\\ndiagnosis.\\nPigmented lesions with the following features should be excised or biopsied:\\n• Recent enlargement\\n• Darkening\\n• Bleeding\\n• Ulceration\\nHowever, these features usually indicate that the melanoma has already invaded the skin deeply. Earlier\\ndiagnosis is possible if biopsy specimens can be obtained from lesions having variegated colors (eg,\\nbrown or black \\nwith shades of red, white, or blue), irregular elevations that are visible or palpable, and\\nborders with angular indentations or notches. Polarized light and immersion contact dermoscopy, which is\\nused to examine pigmented lesions, may be useful for distinguishing melanomas from benign lesions.\\nStaging:\\n The staging of melanoma is based on clinical and pathologic criteria and closely corresponds to\\nthe traditional tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification system. The staging system classifies\\nmelanomas based on local, regional, or distant disease.\\n• Stage I and II: Localized primary melanoma\\n• Stage III: Metastasis to regional lymph nodes\\n• Stage IV: Distant metastatic disease\\nStage strongly correlates with survival.

Principles of Endocrinology\\nIntroduction\\nThe endocrine system coordinates functioning between different organs through hormones, which are\\nreleased into the bloodstream from specific types of cells within endocrine (ductless) glands. Once in\\ncirculation, hormones affect function of the target tissue. Some hormones exert an effect on cells of the\\norgan from which they were released (paracrine effect), some even on the same cell type (autocrine\\neffect). Hormones can be peptides of various sizes, steroids (derived from cholesterol), or amino acid\\nderivatives.\\nHormones bind selectively to receptors located inside or on the surface of target cells. Receptors inside\\ncells interact with hormones that regulate gene function (eg, corticosteroids, vitamin D, thyroid hormone).\\nReceptors on the cell surface bind with hormones that regulate enzyme activity or affect ion channels (eg,\\ngrowth hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone).\\nHypothalamic-Pituitary Relationships\\nPeripheral endocrine organ functions are controlled to varying degrees by pituitary hormones (see also\\nCh. 92\\n). Some functions (eg, secretion of insulin by the pancreas, primarily controlled by the blood\\nglucose level) are controlled to a minimal extent, whereas many (eg, secretion of thyroid or gonadal\\nhormones) are controlled to a great extent. Secretion of pituitary hormones is controlled by the\\nhypothalamus.\\nThe interaction between the hypothalamus and pituitary (hypothalamic-pituitary axis) is a feedback control\\nsystem. The hypothalamus receives input from virtually all other areas of the CNS and uses it to provide\\ninput to the pituitary. In response, the pituitary releases various hormones that stimulate certain endocrine\\nglands throughout the body. Changes in circulating levels of hormones produced by these endocrine\\nglands are detected by the hypothalamus, which then increases or decreases its stimulation of the\\npituitary to maintain homeostasis.\\nThe hypothalamus modulates the activities of the anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary in different\\nways. Neurohormones synthesized in the hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis)\\nthrough a specialized portal vascular system and regulate synthesis and release of the 6 major peptide\\nhormones of the anterior pituitary. These anterior pituitary hormones regulate peripheral endocrine glands\\n(the thyroid, adrenals, and gonads) as well as growth and lactation. No direct neural connection exists\\nbetween the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary. In contrast, the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis)\\ncomprises axons originating from neuronal cell bodies located in the hypothalamus. These axons serve\\nas storage sites for 2 peptide hormones synthesized in the hypothalamus; these hormones act in the\\nperiphery to regulate water balance, milk ejection, and uterine contraction.\\nVirtually all hormones produced by the hypothalamus and the pituitary are released in a \\npulsatile fashion;\\nperiods of such release are interspersed with periods of inactivity. Some hormones (eg,\\nadrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH], growth hormone, prolactin) have definite circadian rhythms; others\\n(eg, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone during the menstrual cycle) have month-long\\nrhythms with superimposed circadian rhythms.\\nHypothalamic Controls\\nThus far, 7 physiologically important hypothalamic neurohormones have been identified (see\\nTable 91-1\\n). Except for the biogenic amine dopamine, all are small peptides. Several are produced in the\\nperiphery as well as in the hypothalamus and function in local paracrine systems, especially in the GI\\ntract. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, which also stimulates the release of prolactin, is one. Neurohormones\\nmay control the release of multiple pituitary hormones. Regulation of most anterior pituitary hormones\\ndepends on stimulatory signals from the hypothalamus; the exception is prolactin, which is regulated by\\ninhibitory stimuli.

Because neurohormones are synthesized in different\\ncenters within the hypothalamus, some disorders affect only one neuropeptide, whereas others affect\\nseveral. The result can be undersecretion or oversecretion of neurohormones. Clinical syndromes that\\nresult from the ensuing pituitary hormone dysfunction (eg, diabetes insipidus, acromegaly,\\nhypopituitarism) are discussed in \\nCh. 92\\n.\\nAnterior Pituitary Function\\nThe cells of the anterior lobe (which constitutes 80% of the pituitary by weight) synthesize and release\\nseveral hormones necessary for normal growth and development and also stimulate the activity of several\\ntarget glands.\\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH):\\n ACTH is also known as corticotropin. Corticotropin-releasing\\nhormone (CRH) is the primary stimulator of ACTH release, but antidiuretic hormone plays a role during\\nstress. ACTH induces the adrenal cortex to release cortisol and several weak androgens, such as\\ndehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Circulating cortisol and other corticosteroids (including exogenous\\ncorticosteroids) inhibit the release of CRH and ACTH. The CRH-ACTH-cortisol axis is a central\\ncomponent of the response to stress. Without ACTH, the adrenal cortex atrophies and cortisol release\\nvirtually ceases.\\n[\\nTable 91-1.\\n Hypothalamic Neurohormones]\\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH):\\n TSH regulates the structure and function of the thyroid gland and\\nstimulates synthesis and release of thyroid hormones. TSH synthesis and release are stimulated by the\\nhypothalamic hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and suppressed (by negative feedback) by\\ncirculating thyroid hormones.\\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):\\n LH and FSH control the\\nproduction of the sex hormones. Synthesis and release of LH and FSH are stimulated by gonadotropin-\\nreleasing hormone (GnRH) and suppressed by estrogen and testosterone. \\nIn women, LH and FSH\\nstimulate ovarian follicular development and ovulation (see p. \\n2497\\n). In men, FSH acts on Sertoli cells\\nand is essential for spermatogenesis; LH acts on Leydig cells of the testes to stimulate testosterone\\nbiosynthesis (see p. \\n2339\\n).\\nGrowth hormone (GH):\\n GH stimulates somatic growth and regulates metabolism. Growth hormone-\\nreleasing hormone (GHRH) is the major stimulator and somatostatin is the major inhibitor of the synthesis\\nand release of GH. GH controls synthesis of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, also called somatomedin-\\nC), which largely controls growth. Although IGF-1 is produced by many tissues, the liver is the major\\nsource. A variant of IGF-1 occurs in muscle, where it plays a role in enhancing muscle strength. It is less\\nunder control of GH than is the liver variant.\\nThe metabolic effects of GH are biphasic. GH initially exerts insulin-like effects, increasing glucose\\nuptake in muscle and fat, stimulating amino acid uptake and protein synthesis in liver and muscle, and\\ninhibiting lipolysis in adipose tissue. Several hours later, more profound anti-insulin-like metabolic effects\\noccur. They include inhibition of glucose uptake and use, causing blood glucose and lipolysis to increase,\\nwhich increases plasma free fatty acids. GH levels increase during fasting, maintaining blood glucose\\nlevels and mobilizing fat as an alternative metabolic fuel. Production of GH decreases with aging. Ghrelin,\\na hormone produced in the fundus of the stomach, promotes GH release from the pituitary, increases food\\nintake, and improves memory.\\nProlactin:\\n Prolactin is produced in cells called lactotrophs that constitute about 30% of the cells of the\\nanterior pituitary. The pituitary doubles in size during pregnancy, largely because of hyperplasia and\\nhypertrophy of lactotrophs. In humans, the major function of prolactin is stimulating milk production. Also,\\nprolactin release occurs during sexual activity and stress. Prolactin may be a sensitive indicator of\\npituitary dysfunction; prolactin is the hormone most frequently produced in excess by pituitary tumors, and\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 91.

These include pro-\\nopiomelanocortin (POMC, which gives rise to ACTH), \\nα\\n- and \\nβ\\n-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), \\nβ\\n-\\nlipotropin (\\nβ\\n-LPH), the enkephalins, and the endorphins. POMC and MSH can cause hyperpigmentation\\nof the skin and are only significant clinically in disorders in which ACTH levels are markedly elevated (eg,\\nAddison's disease, Nelson syndrome). The function of \\nβ\\n-LPH is unknown. Enkephalins and endorphins\\nare endogenous opioids that bind to and activate opioid receptors throughout the CNS.\\nPosterior Pituitary Function\\nThe posterior pituitary releases antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin or arginine vasopressin)\\nand oxytocin. Both hormones are released in response to neural impulses and have half-lives of about 10\\nmin.\\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH):\\n ADH acts primarily to promote water conservation by the kidney by\\nincreasing the permeability of the distal tubular epithelium to water. At high concentrations, ADH also\\ncauses vasoconstriction. Like aldosterone, ADH plays an important role in maintaining fluid homeostasis\\nand vascular and cellular hydration. The main stimulus for ADH release is increased osmotic pressure of\\nwater in the body, which is sensed by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. The other major stimulus is\\nvolume depletion, which is sensed by baroreceptors in the left atrium, pulmonary veins, carotid sinus, and\\naortic arch, and then transmitted to the CNS through the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves. Other\\nstimulants for ADH release include pain, stress, emesis, hypoxia, exercise, hypoglycemia, cholinergic\\nagonists, \\nβ\\n-blockers, angiotensin, and prostaglandins. Inhibitors of ADH release include alcohol, \\nα\\n-\\nblockers, and glucocorticoids.\\nA lack of ADH causes central diabetes insipidus (see p. \\n772\\n); an inability of the kidneys to respond\\nnormally to ADH causes nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (see p. \\n2424\\n). Removal of the pituitary gland\\nusually does not result in permanent diabetes insipidus because some of the remaining hypothalamic\\nneurons produce small amounts of ADH. Copeptin is coproduced with ADH in the posterior pituitary.\\nMeasuring it may be useful in distinguishing the cause of hyponatremia.\\nOxytocin:\\n Oxytocin has 2 major targets: the myoepithelial cells of the breast, which surround the alveoli\\nof the mammary gland, and the smooth muscle cells of the uterus. Suckling stimulates the production of\\noxytocin, which causes the myoepithelial cells to contract. This contraction causes milk to move from the\\nalveoli to large sinuses for ejection (ie, the milk letdown reflex of nursing mothers). Oxytocin stimulates\\ncontraction of uterine smooth muscle cells, and uterine sensitivity to oxytocin increases throughout\\npregnancy. \\nHowever, plasma levels do not increase sharply during parturition, and the role of oxytocin in\\nthe initiation of labor is unclear. There is no recognized stimulus for oxytocin release in men, although\\nmen have extremely low levels.\\nEndocrine Disorders\\nEndocrine disorders can result from dysfunction originating in the peripheral endocrine gland itself\\n(primary disorders) or from understimulation or overstimulation by the pituitary (secondary disorders). The\\ndisorders can result in hormone overproduction (hyperfunction) or underproduction (hypofunction).\\nRarely, endocrine disorders (usually hypofunction) occur because of abnormal tissue responses to\\nhormones. Clinical manifestations of hypofunction disorders are often insidious and nonspecific.\\nHyperfunction:\\n Hyperfunction of endocrine glands may result from overstimulation by the pituitary but is\\nmost commonly due to hyperplasia or neoplasia of the gland itself. In some cases, cancers from other\\ntissues can produce hormones (ectopic hormone production). Hormone excess also can result from\\nexogenous hormone administration. In some cases, patients take hormones without telling the physician\\n(factitious disease). Tissue hypersensitivity to hormones can occur. Antibodies can stimulate peripheral\\nendocrine glands, as occurs in hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease. Destruction of a peripheral endocrine\\ngland can rapidly release stored hormone (eg, thyroid hormones in thyroiditis).

Finally, overproduction of a hormone can occur as an appropriate response to a disease state.\\nHypofunction:\\n Hypofunction of an endocrine gland can result from understimulation by the pituitary.\\nHypofunction originating within the peripheral gland itself can result from congenital or acquired disorders\\n(including autoimmune disorders, tumors, infections, vascular disorders, and toxins). Genetic disorders\\ncausing hypofunction can result from deletion of a gene or by production of an abnormal hormone. A\\ndecrease in hormone production by the peripheral endocrine gland with a resulting increase in production\\nof pituitary regulating hormone can lead to peripheral endocrine gland hyperplasia. For example, if\\nsynthesis of thyroid hormone is defective, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced in excessive\\namounts, causing goiter.\\nSeveral hormones require conversion to an active form after secretion from the peripheral endocrine\\ngland. Certain disorders can block this step (eg, renal disease can inhibit production of the active form of\\nvitamin D). Antibodies to the circulating hormone or its receptor can block the ability of the hormone to\\nbind to its receptor. Disease or drugs can cause increased rate of clearance of hormones. Circulating\\nsubstances may also block the function of hormones. Abnormalities of the receptor or elsewhere in the\\nperipheral endocrine tissue can also cause hypofunction.\\nLaboratory Testing\\nBecause symptoms of endocrine disorders can begin insidiously and may be nonspecific, clinical\\nrecognition is often delayed for months or years. For this reason, biochemical diagnosis is usually\\nessential; it typically requires measuring levels of the peripheral endocrine hormone, the pituitary\\nhormone, or both in the blood.\\nFree or bioavailable hormone (ie, hormone not bound to a specific binding hormone) is generally believed\\nto be the active form. Free or bioavailable hormones are measured using equilibrium dialysis,\\nultrafiltration, or a solvent-extraction method to separate the free and albumin-bound hormone from the\\nbinding globulin. These methods can be expensive and time-consuming. Analog and competitive free\\nhormone assays, although often used commercially, are not always accurate and should not be used.\\nFree hormone levels can also be estimated indirectly by assessing levels of the binding protein and using\\nthem to adjust levels of the total serum hormone. However, indirect methods are inaccurate if the binding\\ncapacity of the hormone-binding protein has been altered (eg, by a disorder).\\nBecause most hormones have circadian rhythms, measurements need to be made at a prescribed time of\\nday. Hormones that vary over short periods (eg, luteinizing hormone) necessitate obtaining 3 or 4 values\\nover 1 or 2 h or using a pooled blood sample. Hormones with week-to-week variation (eg, testosterone)\\nnecessitate obtaining separate values a week apart.\\nIn some cases, indirect estimates are used. For example, because growth hormone (GH) has a short\\nserum half-life and is difficult to detect in serum, serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is\\nproduced in response to GH, is often measured as an index of GH activity. Sometimes, urine (eg, free\\ncortisol when testing for Cushing's disease) or salivary hormone \\nlevels may be used. Whether\\nmeasurement of circulating hormone metabolites indicates the amount of bioavailable hormone is under\\ninvestigation.\\nIn many cases, a dynamic test is necessary. Thus, in the case of hypofunctioning organs, a stimulating\\ntest can be used. In hyperfunction, a suppressive test can be used.\\nTreatment\\nHypofunction disorders are usually treated by replacement of the peripheral endocrine hormone\\nregardless of whether the defect is primary or secondary (an exception is GH replacement for pituitary\\ndwarfism). If resistance to the hormone exists, drugs that reduce resistance can be used (eg, metformin or\\nthiazolidinediones for type 2 diabetes mellitus). Occasionally, a hormone-stimulating drug is used.\\nRadiation therapy, surgery, and drugs that suppress hormone production are used to treat hyperfunction\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 91.

In some cases, a receptor antagonist is used.\\nAging and Endocrinology\\nHormones undergo many changes as a person ages. Most hormone levels decrease. Some remain\\nnormal, including TSH, ACTH (basal), thyroxine, cortisol (basal), 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, insulin\\n(sometimes increases), and estradiol (in men). Hormones that increase, including ACTH (increased\\nresponse to corticotropin-releasing hormone), follicle-stimulating hormone, sex-hormone binding globulin,\\nand activin (in men), gonadotropins (in women), epinephrine (in the oldest old), parathyroid hormone,\\nnorepinephrine, cholecystokinin, vasoactive intestinal peptide and ADH (also loss of circadian rhythm),\\nand atrial natriuretic factor, are associated with either receptor defects or postreceptor defects, resulting\\nin hypofunction. Many age-related changes are similar to those in patients with hormone deficiency,\\nleading to the hypothesis of a hormonal fountain of youth (ie, speculation that some changes associated\\nwith aging can be reversed by the replacement of one or more deficient hormones). Some evidence\\nsuggests that replacing certain hormones in the elderly can improve functional outcomes (eg, muscle\\nstrength, bone mineral density), but little evidence exists regarding effects on mortality. In some cases,\\nreplacing hormones may be harmful, as in estrogen replacement in most older women.\\nA competing theory is that the age-related decline in hormone levels represents a protective slowing\\ndown of cellular metabolism. This concept is based on the rate of living theory of aging (ie, the faster the\\nmetabolic rate of an organism, the quicker it dies). This concept is seemingly supported by studies on the\\neffects of dietary restriction. Restriction decreases levels of hormones that stimulate metabolism, thereby\\nslowing metabolic rate; this prolongs life in rodents.\\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate levels decline dramatically with age. Despite optimism for\\nthe role of DHEA supplementation in older people, most controlled trials failed to show any major\\nbenefits.\\nPregnenolone is the precursor of all known steroid hormones. As with DHEA, its levels decline with age.\\nStudies in the 1940s showed its safety and benefits in people with arthritis, but additional studies failed to\\nshow any beneficial effects on memory and muscle strength.\\nLevels of GH and its peripheral endocrine hormone (IGF-1) decline with age. GH replacement in older\\npeople sometimes increases muscle mass but does not increase muscle strength (although it may in\\nmalnourished people). Adverse effects (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome, arthralgias, water retention) are very\\ncommon. GH may have a role in the short-term treatment of some undernourished older patients, but in\\ncritically ill undernourished patients GH increases mortality. Secretagogues that stimulate GH production\\nin a more physiologic pattern may improve benefit and decrease risk.\\nLevels of melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, also decline with aging. This decline may\\nplay an important role in the loss of circadian rhythms with aging. Estrogen replacement in older women is\\ndiscussed in \\nCh. 247\\n.

Pituitary Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe pituitary gland controls the functions of peripheral endocrine glands. Pituitary structure and function\\nand relationships between the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland are discussed in \\nCh. 91\\n.\\nPituitary Lesions\\nPatients with hypothalamic-pituitary lesions generally present with some combination of symptoms and\\nsigns of a mass lesion (eg, headaches, visual field defects—particularly bitemporal hemianopia or the\\nhemifield slide phenomenon [images drifting apart]—altered appetite, thirst); imaging evidence of a mass\\nlesion as an incidental finding; or hypersecretion or hyposecretion of one or more pituitary hormones.\\nThe most common cause of hypopituitary or hyperpituitary secretion is a pituitary or hypothalamic tumor.\\nA pituitary tumor tends to produce an enlarged sella (sella turcica). Alternatively, an enlarged sella may\\nrepresent empty sella syndrome.\\nEmpty sella syndrome:\\n In this disorder, the sella appears empty because it is filled with CSF, which\\nflattens the pituitary gland against the wall of the sella. The syndrome may be congenital, primary, or\\nsecondary to injury (eg, ischemia after childbirth, surgery, head trauma, or radiation therapy). The typical\\npatient is female (> 80%), obese (about 75%), and hypertensive (30%) and may have idiopathic\\nintracranial hypertension (10%) or spinal fluid rhinorrhea (10%). Pituitary function in patients with empty\\nsella syndrome is frequently normal. However, hypopituitarism may occur, as may headaches and visual\\nfield defects. Occasionally, patients have small coexisting pituitary tumors that secrete growth hormone\\n(GH), prolactin, or ACTH. Diagnosis can be confirmed by CT or MRI. No specific therapy is needed for an\\nempty sella alone.\\nAnterior lobe lesions:\\n Hypersecretion of anterior lobe hormones (hyperpituitarism) is almost always\\nselective. The anterior pituitary hormones most commonly secreted in excess are GH (as in acromegaly,\\ngigantism), prolactin (as in galactorrhea), and ACTH (as in the pituitary type of Cushing's syndrome).\\nHyposecretion of anterior lobe hormones (hypopituitarism) may be generalized, usually due to a pituitary\\ntumor, or is idiopathic, or may involve the selective loss of one or a few pituitary hormones.\\nPosterior lobe lesions:\\n The 2 posterior lobe hormones are oxytocin and ADH. In women, oxytocin\\ncauses myoepithelial cells of the breast and myometrial cells of the uterus to contract. Oxytocin is present\\nin men but has no proven function. Deficiency of ADH results in central diabetes insipidus (see p. \\n772\\n).\\nExcess ADH secretion results in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (see \\nSidebar 97-1\\n on p.\\n826\\n).\\nGeneralized Hypopituitarism\\nGeneralized hypopituitarism refers to endocrine deficiency syndromes due to partial or\\ncomplete loss of anterior lobe pituitary function. Various clinical features occur depending on\\nthe specific hormones that are deficient. Diagnosis involves imaging tests and measurement of\\npituitary hormone levels basally and after various provocative stimuli. Treatment depends on\\ncause but generally includes removal of any tumor and administration of replacement\\nhormones\\n.\\nThe many causes of hypopituitarism are listed in\\nTable 92-1\\n.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nSymptoms and signs relate to the underlying disorder and to the specific pituitary hormones that are\\ndeficient or absent.

Radiation of the spine, either prophylactic or therapeutic, may further\\nimpair the growth potential of the vertebrae and further jeopardize height gain.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nIn a child with hypopituitarism, height is below the 3rd percentile, and growth velocity is < 6 cm/yr before\\nage 4 yr, < 5 cm/yr from age 4 to 8 yr, and < 4 cm/yr before puberty. Skeletal maturation, assessed by\\nbone age determination, is > 2 yr behind chronologic age.\\nAlthough of small stature, a child with hypopituitarism retains normal proportionality between upper and\\nlower body segments. The child fails to begin pubertal development. However, a child with isolated GH\\ndeficiency secondary to hypopituitarism may undergo delayed pubertal development.\\nGrowth data for height and weight should be plotted on a growth chart (auxologic assessment) for all\\nchildren. When growth is abnormal, bone age should be determined from an x-ray of the left hand (by\\nconvention). In GH deficiency, skeletal maturation is usually delayed to the same extent as height.\\nEvaluating the pituitary gland and sella turcica with CT or MRI is indicated to rule out calcifications and\\ntumors; the sella turcica is abnormally small in 10 to 20% of patients.\\nDiagnosis\\n• Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and sometimes IGF binding protein type 3 (IGFBP-3) levels\\n• Usually confirmation by provocative testing\\nIn mid to late childhood, IGF-1 levels, which reflect GH activity, are measured because GH levels are\\nhighly variable and difficult to interpret. Normal IGF-1 levels help exclude GH deficiency. However, IGF-1\\nlevels are low in conditions other than GH deficiency, such as psychosocial deprivation, undernutrition,\\nand hypothyroidism. Because IGF-1 levels are normally low in infancy and early childhood, they do not\\nallow reliable discrimination between normal and subnormal in these age groups. In these children, levels\\nof IGFBP-3 (the major carrier of IGF peptides) are measured. IGFBP-3 is less affected by undernutrition\\nthan is IGF-1.\\nIn children with low levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3, GH deficiency is usually confirmed by measuring GH\\nlevels. Because basal GH levels are typically low or undetectable (except after the onset of sleep),\\nassessment of GH levels requires provocative testing. However, provocative testing is nonphysiologic,\\nsubject to laboratory error, and poorly reproducible, and interpretation of data relies on arbitrary\\ndefinitions of \"normal\" that vary by age and sex.\\nThe insulin tolerance test may be the most effective provocative test for stimulating GH release. Less\\ndangerous, but also less reliable, are tests using arginine infusion (500 mg/kg IV given over 30 min),\\nlevodopa (10 mg/kg to children; 500 mg po to adults), sleep, or 20 min of vigorous exercise. Generally,\\nany GH level > 10 ng/mL or any response of > 5 ng/mL after a stimulus is sufficient to rule out GH\\ndeficiency. Increases in GH of < 5 ng/mL or to levels < 10 ng/mL are difficult to interpret.

Because no single test is 100% effective in eliciting GH release, a 2nd provocative\\ntest should be done if the first is abnormal. GH levels generally peak 30 to 90 min after administration of\\ninsulin or the onset of arginine infusion, 30 to 120 min after levodopa, 60 to 120 min after the onset of\\nsleep, and after 20 min of vigorous exercise.

The\\nvariability in pituitary responsiveness to GHRH is consistent with the hypothesis that intermittent secretion\\nof somatostatin, which opposes GHRH, is responsible for modulating pituitary GH output. Presumably,\\nabsent or diminished increases in GH in response to GHRH identify patients with GH deficiency, but\\nwhether the pattern of response distinguishes primary hypothalamic disease from pituitary disease is\\nunclear. In children with GH deficiency presumably secondary to GHRH deficiency, highly variable GH\\nresponses to GHRH occur. The combination of arginine and GHRH improves the sensitivity for\\ndiagnosing GH deficiency.\\nProvocative testing may not detect subtle defects in the regulation of GH release. For example, in\\nchildren with short stature secondary to GH secretory dysfunction, results of provocative testing for GH\\nrelease are usually normal.

With therapy, height velocity often increases to 10\\nto 12 cm/yr in the first year and, although it increases more slowly thereafter, remains above pretreatment\\nrates. Therapy is continued until an acceptable height is reached or growth rate falls below 2.5 cm/yr.\\nAdverse effects of GH therapy are few but include idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor\\ncerebri), slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and transient mild peripheral edema. Before the advent of\\nrecombinant GH, GH extracted from pituitary glands was used. This preparation rarely led to Creutzfeldt-\\nJakob disease 20 to 40 yr after treatment (see p. \\n1729\\n). Pituitary-extracted GH was last used in the\\n1980s.\\nIt is controversial whether short children with clinical features of GH deficiency but with normal GH\\nsecretion and normal IGF-1 levels should be treated with GH. Many experts recommend a trial of GH\\ntherapy for 6 to 12 mo, continuing GH only if there is a doubling of or an increase of 3 cm/yr over the\\npretreatment height velocity. Others object to this approach because it is expensive, is experimental, may\\nlead to adverse effects, labels otherwise healthy children as abnormal, and raises ethical and\\npsychosocial concerns that feed into the bias of \"heightism.\"\\nCortisol and thyroid hormone should be replaced throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood in\\npatients with short stature due to pituitary dwarfism when circulating levels of these hormones are low\\n(see pp. \\n786\\n and \\n794\\n).

Before closure of the\\nepiphyses, the result is gigantism. Later, the result is acromegaly, which causes distinctive\\nfacial and other features. Diagnosis is clinical and by skull and hand x-rays and measurement of\\ngrowth hormone levels. Treatment involves removal or destruction of the responsible\\nadenoma.\\nMany growth hormone (GH)-secreting adenomas contain a mutant form of the G\\ns\\n protein, which is a\\nstimulatory regulator of adenylate cyclase. Cells with the mutant form of G\\ns\\n protein secrete GH even in\\nthe absence of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). A few cases of ectopic GHRH-producing\\ntumors, especially of the pancreas and lung, also have been described.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nPituitary gigantism:\\n This rare condition occurs if GH hypersecretion begins in childhood, before closure\\nof the epiphyses. Skeletal growth velocity and ultimate stature are increased, but little bony deformity\\noccurs. However, soft-tissue swelling occurs, and the peripheral nerves are enlarged. Delayed puberty or\\nhypogonadotropic hypogonadism is also frequently present, resulting in a eunuchoid habitus.\\nAcromegaly:\\n In acromegaly, GH hypersecretion usually starts between the 20s and 40s. When GH\\nhypersecretion begins after epiphyseal closure, the earliest clinical manifestations are coarsening of the\\nfacial features (see\\nPlate 21\\n) and soft-tissue swelling of the hands and feet. Appearance changes, and larger rings, gloves,\\nand shoes are needed. Photographs of the patient are important in delineating the course of the disease.\\nIn adults with acromegaly, coarse body hair increases and the skin thickens and frequently darkens. The\\nsize and function of sebaceous and sweat glands increase, such that patients frequently complain of\\nexcessive perspiration and offensive body odor. Overgrowth of the mandible leads to protrusion of the\\njaw (prognathism) and malocclusion of teeth. Cartilaginous proliferation of the larynx leads to a deep,\\nhusky voice. The tongue is frequently enlarged and furrowed. In longstanding acromegaly, costal cartilage\\ngrowth leads to a barrel chest. Articular cartilaginous proliferation occurs early in response to GH excess,\\nwith the articular cartilage possibly undergoing necrosis and erosion. Joint symptoms are common, and\\ncrippling degenerative arthritis may occur.\\nPeripheral neuropathies occur commonly because of compression of nerves by adjacent fibrous tissue\\nand endoneural fibrous proliferation. Headaches are common because of the pituitary tumor. Bitemporal\\nhemianopia may develop if suprasellar extension compresses the optic chiasm. The heart, liver, kidneys,\\nspleen, thyroid, parathyroid glands, and pancreas are larger than normal. Cardiac disease occurs in\\nperhaps one third of patients, with a doubling in the risk of death from cardiac disease. Hypertension\\noccurs in up to one third of patients. The risk of cancer, particularly of the GI tract, increases 2-fold to 3-\\nfold. GH increases tubular reabsorption of phosphate and leads to mild hyperphosphatemia. Impaired\\nglucose tolerance occurs in nearly one half the patients with acromegaly and in gigantism, but clinically\\nsignificant diabetes mellitus occurs in only about 10% of patients.\\nGalactorrhea occurs in some women with acromegaly, usually in association with hyperprolactinemia (see\\np. \\n770\\n). However, galactorrhea may occur with GH excess alone, because GH itself stimulates lactation.\\nDecreased gonadotropin secretion often occurs with GH-secreting tumors.

X-rays of\\nthe hands show tufting of the terminal phalanges and soft-tissue thickening. Generally, glucose tolerance\\nis abnormal and serum phosphate levels are mildly elevated.\\nSerum IGF-1 should be measured in patients with suspected acromegaly; IGF-1 levels are typically\\nsubstantially elevated (3-fold to 10-fold), and because IGF-1 levels do not fluctuate like GH levels do,\\nthey are the simplest way to assess GH hypersecretion. IGF-1 levels also can be used to monitor\\nresponse to therapy.\\nPlasma GH levels measured by radioimmunoassay are typically elevated. Blood should be taken before\\nthe patient eats breakfast (basal state); in normal people, basal GH levels are < 5 ng/mL. Transient\\nelevations of GH are normal and must be distinguished from pathologic hypersecretion. The degree of\\nGH suppression after a glucose load remains the standard and thus should be measured in patients with\\nelevated plasma GH; however, the results are assay-dependent, and the cutoff for normal suppression is\\ncontroversial.

Lungs and pancreas may\\nbe first evaluated in searching for the sites of ectopic production.\\nTreatment\\n• Surgery or radiation therapy\\nAblative therapy with surgery or radiation is generally indicated. Transsphenoidal resection is preferred,\\nbut choices vary at different institutions. Stereotactic supervoltage radiation, delivering about 5000 cGy to\\nthe pituitary, is used, but GH levels may not fall to normal for several years. Treatment with accelerated\\nprotons (heavy particle radiation) permits delivery of larger doses of radiation (equivalent to 10,000 cGy)\\nto the pituitary; such therapy poses higher risk of cranial nerve and hypothalamic damage and is available\\nonly in a few centers. Development of hypopituitarism several years after irradiation is common. Because\\nradiation damage is cumulative, proton beam therapy should not be used after conventional \\nγ\\n-irradiation.\\nA combined approach with both surgery and radiation therapy is indicated for patients with progressive\\nextrasellar involvement by a pituitary tumor and for patients whose entire tumor cannot be resected, which\\nis often the case.\\nSurgical removal of the tumor is likely to have been curative if GH levels after the glucose tolerance test\\nand IGF-1 levels reach normal values. If one or both values are abnormal, further therapy is usually\\nneeded. If GH excess is poorly controlled, hypertension, heart failure, and a doubling in the death rate\\noccur. If GH levels are < 5 ng/mL, however, mortality does not increase.\\nIn general, drug therapy is indicated if surgery and radiation therapy are contraindicated, if they have not\\nbeen curative, or if radiation therapy is being given time to work. In such instances, a somatostatin\\nanalog, octreotide, is given at 0.05 to 0.15 mg sc q 8 to 12 h; it suppresses GH secretion effectively in\\npatients refractory to bromocriptine, surgery, or irradiation. Longer-acting somatostatin analogs, such as\\nmannitol-modified release octreotide (octreotide LAR) given 10 to 30 mg IM q 4 to 6 wk and lanreotide\\ngiven 30 mg IM q 10 to 14 days, are more convenient. Bromocriptine mesylate (1.25 to 5 mg po bid) may\\neffectively lower GH levels in a small percentage of patients but is less effective than somatostatin\\nanalogs.\\nPegvisomant, a GH receptor blocker, has been shown to reduce the effects of GH and lower IGF-1 levels\\nin people with acromegaly, without apparent increase in pituitary tumor size.

A spray bottle that delivers 10 \\nμ\\ng of\\ndesmopressin in 0.1 mL of fluid is easier to use but delivers a fixed quantity. For each patient, the duration\\nof action of a given dose must be established, because variation among individuals is great. The duration\\nof action can be established by following timed urine volumes and osmolality. The nightly dose is the\\nlowest dose required to prevent nocturia. The morning and evening doses should be adjusted separately.\\nThe usual dosage range in adults is 10 to 40 \\nμ\\ng, with most adults requiring 10 \\nμ\\ng bid. For children age 3\\nmo to 12 yr, the usual dosage range is 2.5 to 10 \\nμ\\ng bid.

Headache may be a troublesome adverse effect but generally\\ndisappears if the dosage is reduced. Infrequently, desmopressin causes a slight increase in BP.\\nAbsorption from the nasal mucosa may be erratic, especially when URI or allergic rhinitis occurs. When\\nintranasal delivery of desmopressin is inappropriate, it may be administered sc using about one tenth the\\nintranasal dose. Desmopressin may \\nbe used IV if a rapid effect is necessary (eg, for hypovolemia).

Thyroid Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe thyroid gland, located in the anterior neck just below the cricoid cartilage, consists of 2 lobes\\nconnected by an isthmus. Follicular cells in the gland produce the 2 main thyroid hormones,\\ntetraiodothyronine (thyroxine, T\\n4\\n) and triiodothyronine (T\\n3\\n). These hormones act on cells in virtually\\nevery body tissue by combining with nuclear receptors and altering expression of a wide range of gene\\nproducts. Thyroid hormone is required for normal brain and somatic tissue development in the fetus and\\nneonate, and, in people of all ages, regulates protein, carbohydrate, and fat metabolism.\\nT\\n3\\n is the most active form; T\\n4\\n has only minimal hormonal activity. However, T\\n4\\n is much longer lasting and\\ncan be converted to T\\n3\\n (in most tissues) and thus serves as a reservoir for T\\n3\\n. A 3rd form of thyroid\\nhormone, reverse T\\n3\\n (rT\\n3\\n), has no metabolic activity; levels of rT\\n3\\n increase in certain diseases.\\nAdditionally, parafollicular cells (C cells) secrete the hormone calcitonin, which is released in response to\\nhypercalcemia and lowers serum Ca levels (see p. \\n838\\n).\\nSynthesis and Release of Thyroid Hormones\\nSynthesis of thyroid hormones requires iodine (see\\nFig. 93-1\\n). Iodine, ingested in food and water as iodide, is actively concentrated by the thyroid and\\nconverted to organic iodine (organification) within follicular cells by thyroid peroxidase. The follicular cells\\nsurround a space filled with colloid, which consists of thyroglobulin, a glycoprotein containing tyrosine\\nwithin its matrix. Tyrosine in contact with the membrane of the follicular cells is iodinated at 1\\n(monoiodotyrosine) or 2 (diiodotyrosine) sites and then coupled to produce the 2 forms of thyroid\\nhormone (diiodotyrosine + diiodotyrosine \\n T\\n4\\n; diiodotyrosine + monoiodotyrosine \\n T\\n3\\n).\\n[\\nFig. 93-1.\\n Synthesis of thyroid hormones.]\\nT\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n remain incorporated in thyroglobulin within the follicle until the follicular cells take up\\nthyroglobulin as colloid droplets. Once inside the thyroid follicular cells, T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n are cleaved from\\nthyroglobulin. Free T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n are then released into the bloodstream, where they are bound to serum\\nproteins for transport, the major one being thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), which has high affinity but\\nlow capacity for T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n. TBG normally carries about 75% of bound thyroid hormones. The other\\nbinding proteins are thyroxine-binding prealbumin (transthyretin), which has high affinity but low capacity\\nfor T\\n4\\n, and albumin, which has low affinity but high capacity for T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n. About 0.3% of total serum T\\n3\\nand 0.03% of total serum T\\n4\\n are free and in equilibrium with bound hormones. Only free T\\n3\\n and free T\\n4\\nare available to act on the peripheral tissues.\\nAll reactions necessary for the formation and release of T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n are controlled by thyroid-stimulating\\nhormone (TSH), which is secreted by pituitary thyrotropic cells. TSH secretion is controlled by a negative\\nfeedback mechanism in the pituitary: Increased levels of free T\\n4\\n and T\\n3\\n inhibit TSH synthesis and\\nsecretion, whereas decreased levels increase TSH secretion. TSH secretion is also influenced by\\nthyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is synthesized in the hypothalamus. The precise\\nmechanisms regulating TRH synthesis and release are unclear, although negative feedback from thyroid\\nhormones inhibits TRH synthesis.\\nMost circulating T\\n3\\n is produced outside the thyroid by monodeiodination of T\\n4\\n. Only one fifth of\\ncirculating T\\n3\\n is secreted directly by the thyroid.\\nLaboratory Testing of Thyroid Function\\nTSH measurement is the best means of determining thyroid dysfunction (see\\nTable 93-1\\n). Normal results essentially rule out hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, except in rare patients\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 93. Thyroid Disorders\\n901'),\n",

Thus, a patient may be physiologically normal but have an abnormal total serum\\nT\\n4\\n level. Free T\\n4\\n in the serum can be measured directly, avoiding the pitfalls of interpreting total T\\n4\\nlevels.\\nFree T\\n4\\n index is a calculated value that corrects total T\\n4\\n for the effects of varying amounts of thyroid\\nhormone-binding serum proteins and thus gives an estimate of free T\\n4\\n when total T\\n4\\n is measured. The\\nthyroid hormone-binding ratio or T\\n3\\n resin uptake is used to estimate protein binding. Free T\\n4\\n index is\\nreadily available and compares well with direct measurement of free T\\n4\\n.\\nTotal serum T\\n3\\n and free T\\n3\\n can also be measured. Because T\\n3\\n is tightly bound to TBG (although 10\\ntimes less so than T\\n4\\n), total serum T\\n3\\n levels are influenced by alterations in serum TBG level and by\\ndrugs that affect binding to TBG. Free T\\n3\\n levels in the serum are measured by the same direct and\\nindirect methods (free T\\n3\\n index) described for T\\n4\\n and are used mainly for evaluating thyrotoxicosis.\\nTBG can be measured; it is increased in pregnancy, by estrogen therapy or oral contraceptive use, and in\\nthe acute phase of infectious hepatitis. TBG may also be increased by an X-linked abnormality. It is most\\ncommonly decreased by illnesses that reduce hepatic protein synthesis, use of anabolic steroids, and\\nexcessive corticosteroid use. Large doses of certain drugs, such as phenytoin and aspirin and their\\nderivatives, displace T\\n4\\n from its binding sites on TBG, which spuriously lowers total serum T\\n4\\n levels.\\nAutoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase are present in almost all patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (some\\nof whom also have autoantibodies to thyroglobulin) and in most patients with Graves' disease. These\\nautoantibodies are markers of autoimmune disease but probably do not cause disease. However, an\\nautoantibody directed against the TSH receptor on the thyroid follicular cell is responsible for the\\nhyperthyroidism in Graves' disease. \\nAntibodies against T\\n4\\n and T\\n3\\n may be found in patients with\\nautoimmune thyroid disease and may affect T\\n4\\n and T\\n3\\n measurements but are rarely clinically significant.\\nThe thyroid is the only source of thyroglobulin, which is readily detectable in the serum of healthy people\\nand is usually elevated in patients with nontoxic or toxic goiter. The principal use of serum thyroglobulin\\nmeasurement is in evaluating patients after near-total or total thyroidectomy (with or without \\n131\\nI ablation)\\nfor differentiated thyroid cancer. Normal or elevated serum thyroglobulin values indicate the presence of\\nresidual normal or cancerous thyroid tissue in patients receiving TSH-suppressive doses of L-thyroxine or\\nafter withdrawal of L-thyroxine. However, thyroglobulin antibodies can interfere with thyroglobulin\\nmeasurement.\\nRadioactive iodine uptake can be measured.

Graves' disease (like Hashimoto's\\nthyroiditis) sometimes occurs with other autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo,\\npremature graying of hair, pernicious anemia, connective tissue diseases, and polyglandular deficiency\\nsyndrome. The pathogenesis of infiltrative ophthalmopathy (responsible for the exophthalmos in Graves'\\ndisease) is poorly understood but may result from immunoglobulins directed to specific receptors in the\\norbital fibroblasts and fat that result in release of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammation, and\\naccumulation of glycosaminoglycans. Ophthalmopathy may also occur before the onset of\\nhyperthyroidism or as late as 20 yr afterward and frequently worsens or abates independently of the\\nclinical course of hyperthyroidism. Typical ophthalmopathy in the presence of normal thyroid function is\\ncalled euthyroid Graves' disease.\\nInappropriate TSH secretion\\n is a rare cause. Patients with hyperthyroidism have essentially\\nundetectable TSH except for those with a TSH-secreting anterior pituitary \\nadenoma or pituitary resistance\\nto thyroid hormone. TSH levels are high, and the TSH produced in both disorders is biologically more\\nactive than normal TSH. An increase in the \\nα\\n-subunit of TSH in the blood (helpful in differential diagnosis)\\noccurs in patients with a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma.\\nMolar pregnancy, choriocarcinoma, and hyperemesis gravidarum\\n produce high levels of serum\\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a weak thyroid stimulator. Levels of hCG are highest during the 1st\\ntrimester of pregnancy and result in the decrease in serum TSH and mild increase in serum free T\\n4\\nsometimes observed at that time. The increased thyroid stimulation may be caused by increased levels of\\npartially desialated hCG, an hCG variant that seems to be a more potent thyroid stimulator than more\\nsialated hCG. Hyperthyroidism in molar pregnancy, choriocarcinoma, and hyperemesis gravidarum is\\ntransient; normal thyroid function resumes when the molar pregnancy is evacuated, the choriocarcinoma\\nis appropriately treated, or the hyperemesis gravidarum abates.\\nNonautoimmune autosomal dominant hyperthyroidism\\n manifests during infancy. It results from\\nmutations in the TSH receptor gene that produce continuous thyroid stimulation.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 93. Thyroid Disorders\\n906\"),\n",

As the hypometabolic\\nstate is corrected, anemia subsides, sometimes requiring 6 to 9 mo.\\nSerum cholesterol is usually high in primary hypothyroidism but less so in secondary hypothyroidism.\\nIn addition to primary and secondary hypothyroidism, other conditions may cause decreased levels of\\ntotal T\\n4\\n, such as serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) deficiency, some drugs (see p. \\n785\\n), and\\neuthyroid sick syndrome (see p. \\n779\\n).\\nTreatment\\n• L-Thyroxine, adjusted until TSH levels are in midnormal range\\nVarious thyroid hormone preparations are available for replacement therapy, including synthetic\\npreparations of T\\n4\\n (L-thyroxine), T\\n3\\n (liothyronine), combinations of the 2 synthetic hormones, and\\ndesiccated animal thyroid extract. L-Thyroxine is preferred; the usual maintenance dose is 75 to 150 \\nμ\\ng\\npo once/day, depending on age, body mass index, and absorption (for pediatric doses, see p. \\n2888\\n).\\nTherapy is begun with low doses, especially in the elderly, usually 25 \\nμ\\ng once/day. The dose is adjusted\\nevery 6 wk until maintenance dose is achieved. The maintenance dose may need to be decreased in\\nelderly patients and increased in pregnant women. Dose may also need to be increased if drugs that\\ndecrease T\\n4\\n absorption or increase its biliary excretion are administered concomitantly. The dose used\\nshould be the lowest that restores serum TSH levels to the midnormal range (though this criterion cannot\\nbe used in patients with secondary hypothyroidism).\\nLiothyronine should not be used alone for long-term replacement because of its short half-life and the\\nlarge peaks in serum T\\n3\\n levels it produces. The administration of standard replacement amounts (25 to\\n37.5 \\nμ\\ng bid) results in rapidly increasing serum T\\n3\\n to between 300 and 1000 ng/dL (4.62 to 15.4 nmol/L)\\nwithin \\n4 h due to its almost complete absorption; these levels return to normal by 24 h. Additionally,\\npatients receiving liothyronine are chemically hyperthyroid for at least several hours a day, potentially\\nincreasing cardiac risks.\\nSimilar patterns of serum T\\n3\\n occur when mixtures of T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n are taken po, although peak T\\n3\\n is lower\\nbecause less T\\n3\\n is given. Replacement regimens with synthetic T\\n4\\n preparations reflect a different pattern\\nin serum T\\n3\\n response.

Adrenal Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nThe adrenal glands, located on the cephalad portion of each kidney, consist of a cortex and medulla,\\neach with separate endocrine functions.\\nCortex:\\n The adrenal cortex produces glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily\\naldosterone), and androgens (primarily dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione). Physiology of the\\nhypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical system is further discussed in \\nCh. 91\\n.\\nGlucocorticoids promote and inhibit gene transcription in many cells and organ systems. Prominent\\neffects include anti-inflammatory actions and increased hepatic gluconeogenesis.\\nMineralocorticoids regulate electrolyte transport across epithelial surfaces, particularly renal conservation\\nof Na in exchange for K.\\nAdrenal androgens\\' chief physiologic activity occurs after conversion to testosterone and\\ndihydrotestosterone.\\nMedulla:\\n The adrenal medulla is composed of chromaffin cells, which synthesize and secrete\\ncatecholamines (mainly epinephrine and lesser amounts of norepinephrine). Chromaffin cells also\\nproduce bioactive amines and peptides (eg, histamine, serotonin, chromogranins, neuropeptide\\nhormones). Epinephrine and norepinephrine, the major effector amines of the \\nsympathetic nervous\\nsystem, are responsible for the \"flight or fight\" response (ie, chronotropic and inotropic effects on the\\nheart; bronchodilation; peripheral and splanchnic vasoconstriction with skeletal muscular vasodilation;\\nmetabolic effects including glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and renin release).\\nClinical syndromes:\\n Most deficiency syndromes affect output of all adrenocortical hormones.\\nHypofunction may be primary (malfunction of the adrenal gland itself, as in Addison\\'s disease) or\\nsecondary (due to lack of adrenal stimulation by the pituitary or hypothalamus, although some experts\\nrefer to hypothalamic malfunction as tertiary).\\nHyperfunction causes distinct clinical syndromes. Hypersecretion of androgens results in adrenal virilism;\\nof glucocorticoids, Cushing\\'s syndrome; and of aldosterone, hyperaldosteronism (aldosteronism). These\\nsyndromes frequently have overlapping features. Hyperfunction may be compensatory, as in congenital\\nadrenal hyperplasia (see p. \\n2889\\n), or due to acquired hyperplasia, adenomas, or adenocarcinomas.\\nExcess quantities of epinephrine and norepinephrine are produced in pheochromocytoma.\\nAddison\\'s Disease\\n(Primary or Chronic Adrenocortical Insufficiency)\\nAddison\\'s disease is an insidious, usually progressive hypofunctioning of the adrenal cortex. It\\ncauses various symptoms, including hypotension and hyperpigmentation, and can lead to\\nadrenal crisis with cardiovascular collapse. Diagnosis is clinical and by finding elevated plasma\\nACTH with low plasma cortisol. Treatment depends on the cause but generally includes\\nhydrocortisone and sometimes other hormones\\n.\\nAddison\\'s disease develops in about 4/100,000 annually. It occurs in all age groups, about equally in each\\nsex, and tends to become clinically apparent during metabolic stress or trauma.

A low serum concentration of Na and a high concentration of K result.\\nInability to concentrate the urine, combined with changes in electrolyte balance, cause severe\\ndehydration, plasma hypertonicity, acidosis, decreased circulatory volume, hypotension, and, eventually,\\ncirculatory collapse. However, when adrenal insufficiency is caused by inadequate ACTH production\\n(secondary adrenal insufficiency—see p. \\n795\\n), electrolyte levels are often normal or only mildly deranged.\\nGlucocorticoid deficiency:\\n Glucocorticoid deficiency contributes to hypotension and causes severe\\ninsulin sensitivity and disturbances in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. In the absence of\\ncortisol, insufficient carbohydrate is formed from protein; hypoglycemia and diminished liver glycogen\\nresult. Weakness follows, due in part to deficient neuromuscular function. Resistance to infection, trauma,\\nand other stress is diminished. Myocardial weakness and dehydration reduce cardiac output, and\\ncirculatory failure can occur. Decreased blood cortisol results in increased pituitary ACTH production and\\nincreased blood \\nβ\\n-lipotropin, which has melanocyte-stimulating activity and, together with ACTH, causes\\nthe hyperpigmentation of skin and mucous membranes characteristic of Addison's disease. Thus, adrenal\\ninsufficiency secondary to pituitary failure (see p. \\n795\\n) does not cause hyperpigmentation.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nWeakness, fatigue, and orthostatic hypotension are early symptoms and signs. \\nHyperpigmentation is\\ncharacterized by diffuse tanning of exposed and, to a lesser extent, unexposed portions of the body,\\nespecially on pressure points (bony prominences), skin folds, scars, and extensor surfaces. Black\\nfreckles are common on the forehead, face, neck, and shoulders. Areas of vitiligo develop, as do bluish\\nblack discolorations of the areolae and mucous membranes of the lips, mouth, rectum, and vagina.\\nAnorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea often occur. Decreased tolerance to cold, with hypometabolism,\\nmay be noted. Dizziness and syncope may occur. The gradual onset and nonspecific nature of early\\nsymptoms often lead to an incorrect initial diagnosis of neurosis. Weight loss, dehydration, and\\nhypotension are characteristic of the later stages of Addison's disease.\\nAdrenal crisis:\\n Adrenal crisis is characterized by profound asthenia; severe pain in the abdomen, lower\\nback, or legs; peripheral vascular collapse; and, finally, renal shutdown with azotemia. Body temperature\\nmay be low, although severe fever often occurs, particularly when crisis is precipitated by acute infection.\\nA significant number of patients with partial loss of adrenal function (limited adrenocortical reserve)\\nappear well but experience adrenal crisis when under physiologic stress (eg, surgery, infection, burns,\\ncritical illness).

Low ACTH (< 5 pg/mL) and cortisol suggest secondary\\nadrenal insufficiency (see p. \\n795\\n); it is important \\nto note that ACTH levels within the normal range are\\ninappropriate for very low cortisol levels.\\nIf ACTH and cortisol levels are borderline and adrenal insufficiency is clinically suspected—particularly in\\na patient who is about to undergo major surgery—provocative testing must be done. If time is too short\\n(eg, emergency surgery), the patient is given hydrocortisone empirically (eg, 100 mg IV or IM), and\\nprovocative testing is done subsequently.\\nAddison's disease is diagnosed by showing failure of exogenous ACTH to increase serum cortisol.\\nSecondary adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed by a prolonged ACTH stimulation test, insulin tolerance\\ntest, or glucagon test.\\nACTH stimulation testing is done by injecting cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH) 250 \\nμ\\ng IV or IM. Some\\nauthorities believe that in patients with suspected secondary adrenal insufficiency, a low-dose ACTH\\nstimulation test using 1 \\nμ\\ng IV instead of the standard 250 \\nμ\\ng should be done, because such patients may\\nreact normally to the higher dose. Patients taking glucocorticoid supplements or spironolactone should\\nnot take them on the day of the test.

Patients with Addison's\\ndisease have low or low-normal values that do not rise above 20 \\nμ\\ng/dL at 30 min. A normal response to\\ncosyntropin may occur in secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Results for the first hour are similar for both the short (sampling stopped after 1 h) and prolonged\\ntests, but in Addison's disease there is no further rise beyond 60 min. In secondary and tertiary adrenal\\ninsufficiency, cortisol levels continue to rise for ≥ 24 h. Only in cases of prolonged adrenal atrophy is\\nadrenal priming (with long-acting ACTH) necessary.

Adrenal hyperplasia is usually congenital; delayed virilizing adrenal\\nhyperplasia is a variant of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (see p. \\n2889\\n). Both are caused by a defect in\\nhydroxylation of cortisol precursors; cortisol precursors accumulate and are shunted into the production\\nof androgens. The defect is only partial in delayed virilizing adrenal hyperplasia, so clinical disease may\\nnot develop until adulthood.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nEffects depend on the patient's sex and age at onset and are more noticeable in women than in men.\\nSymptoms and signs include hirsutism (sometimes the only sign in mild cases), baldness, acne, and\\ndeepening of the voice. Libido may increase. In prepubertal children, growth may accelerate. If untreated,\\npremature epiphyseal closure and short stature occur. Affected prepubertal males may experience\\npremature sexual maturation. Females may have amenorrhea, atrophy of the uterus, clitoral hypertrophy,\\ndecreased breast size, and increased muscularity. In adult men, the excess adrenal androgens may\\nsuppress gonadal function and cause infertility.

A central-to-peripheral ACTH ratio > 3 virtually excludes ectopic ACTH\\nsyndrome, whereas a ratio < 3 suggests a need to seek such a source.\\nPituitary imaging is done if ACTH levels and provocative tests suggest a pituitary cause; gadolinium-\\nenhanced MRI is most accurate, but some microadenomas are visible on CT.

If clinical manifestations are severe, it may be reasonable to block corticosteroid\\nsecretion with metyrapone 250 mg to 1 g po tid or ketoconazole 400 mg po once/day, increasing to a\\nmaximum of 400 mg tid. Ketoconazole is more readily available but slower in onset and sometimes\\nhepatotoxic.\\nPituitary tumors that produce excessive ACTH are removed surgically or extirpated with radiation.

Younger patients usually receive supervoltage irradiation of the pituitary,\\ndelivering 45 Gy. Improvement usually occurs in < 1 yr. However, in children, irradiation may reduce\\nsecretion of growth hormone and occasionally cause precocious puberty. In special centers, heavy\\nparticle beam irradiation, providing about 100 Gy, is often successful, as is a single focused beam of\\nradiation therapy given as a single dose—radiosurgery. Response to irradiation occasionally requires\\nseveral years, but response is more rapid in children.\\nBilateral adrenalectomy is reserved for patients with pituitary hyperadrenocorticism who do not respond to\\nboth pituitary exploration (with possible adenomectomy) and irradiation.

Symptoms and signs include\\nepisodic weakness, elevated BP, and hypokalemia. Diagnosis includes measurement of plasma\\naldosterone levels and plasma renin activity. Treatment depends on cause. A tumor is removed\\nif possible; in hyperplasia, spironolactone or related drugs may normalize BP and eliminate\\nother clinical features\\n.\\nAldosterone is the most potent mineralocorticoid produced by the adrenals. It causes Na retention and K\\nloss. In the kidney, aldosterone causes transfer of Na from the lumen of the distal tubule into the tubular\\ncells in exchange for K and hydrogen. The same effect occurs in salivary glands, sweat glands, cells of\\nthe intestinal mucosa, and in exchanges between ICFs and ECFs.\\nAldosterone secretion is regulated by the renin-angiotensin system and, to a lesser extent, by ACTH.\\nRenin, a proteolytic enzyme, is stored in the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidneys. Reduction in blood\\nvolume and flow in the afferent renal arterioles induces secretion of renin. Renin transforms\\nangiotensinogen from the liver to angiotensin I, which is transformed by ACE to angiotensin II. Angiotensin\\nII causes secretion of aldosterone and, to a much lesser extent, secretion of cortisol and\\ndeoxycorticosterone; it also has pressor activity. Na and water retention resulting from increased\\naldosterone secretion increases the blood volume and reduces renin secretion.\\nPrimary aldosteronism is caused by an adenoma, usually unilateral, of the glomerulosa cells of the\\nadrenal cortex or, more rarely, by adrenal carcinoma or hyperplasia. Adenomas are extremely rare in\\nchildren, but the syndrome sometimes occurs in childhood adrenal carcinoma or hyperplasia. In adrenal\\nhyperplasia, which is more common among older men, both adrenals are overactive, and no adenoma is\\npresent. The clinical picture can also occur with congenital adrenal hyperplasia from deficiency of 11 \\nβ\\n-\\nhydroxylase and the dominantly inherited dexamethasone-suppressible hyperaldosteronism.

Polyglandular Deficiency Syndromes\\nIntroduction\\n(Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndromes; Polyendocrine Deficiency Syndromes)\\nPolyglandular deficiency syndromes (PDS) are characterized by sequential or simultaneous\\ndeficiencies in the function of several endocrine glands that have a common cause. Etiology is\\nmost often autoimmune. Symptoms depend on the combination of deficiencies, which fall\\nwithin 1 of 3 types. Diagnosis requires measurement of hormone levels and autoantibodies\\nagainst affected endocrine glands. Treatment includes replacement of missing or deficient\\nhormones and sometimes immunosuppressants\\n.\\nEtiology\\nAlthough individual endocrine glands can be damaged by numerous causes, including infection,\\ninfarction, and tumors, these syndromes usually result from an autoimmune reaction, probably triggered\\nby a virus or other environmental antigen.\\nGenetic factors increase susceptibility to these syndromes, as shown by the increased presence of\\ncertain HLA subtypes in affected people and the recognition of several inheritance patterns (see\\nTable 95-1\\n).\\nPathophysiology\\nThe underlying autoimmune reaction involves autoantibodies against endocrine tissues, cell-mediated\\nautoimmunity, or both and leads to inflammation, lymphocytic infiltration, and partial or complete gland\\ndestruction.

Porphyrias\\nIntroduction\\nPorphyrias result from genetic deficiencies of enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway.\\nThese deficiencies allow heme precursors to accumulate, causing toxicity. Porphyrias are\\ndefined by the specific enzyme deficiency. Two major clinical manifestations occur:\\nneurovisceral abnormalities (the acute porphyrias) and cutaneous photosensitivity (the\\ncutaneous porphyrias)\\n.\\nHeme, an iron-containing pigment, is synthesized mostly in the bone marrow (by erythroblasts and\\nreticulocytes) and is incorporated into hemoglobin. Heme is also synthesized in the liver and incorporated\\ninto certain enzymes (eg, cytochromes). Heme synthesis requires 8 enzymes (see\\nTable 96-1\\n). These enzymes produce and transform molecular species called porphyrins (and their\\nprecursors), which are toxic if they accumulate.\\nEtiology\\nMost porphyrias are autosomal dominant. Homozygous or double heterozygous states may be\\nincompatible with life, generally causing fetal death; the exceptions are \\nδ\\n-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)\\ndehydratase (ALAD)-deficiency porphyria and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase deficiency, in which only\\nhomozygous or double heterozygous conditions (ie, 2 separate heterozygous mutations in the same gene\\nin the same patient) cause disease. Disease penetrance in heterozygotes varies. In terms of genetic\\nprevalence, the 2 most common porphyrias are acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) and porphyria cutanea\\ntarda (PCT). The prevalence of each is about 1/10,000.\\nPathophysiology\\nPorphyrias result from a deficiency of any of the last 7 enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway\\n(deficiency of the first enzyme in the pathway, ALA synthase, causes sideroblastic anemia). Single genes\\nencode each enzyme; any of numerous possible mutations can incapacitate the enzyme encoded by that\\ngene. When an enzyme of heme synthesis is deficient or defective, its substrate and any other heme\\nprecursors normally modified by that enzyme may accumulate in bone marrow, liver, skin, or other tissues\\nand have toxic effects. These precursors may appear in excess in the blood and be excreted in urine,\\nbile, or stool.\\n[\\nTable 96-1.\\n Substrates and Enzymes of the Heme Biosynthetic Pathway and the Diseases Associated\\nwith their Deficiency]\\nAlthough porphyrias are most precisely defined according to the deficient enzyme, classification by major\\nclinical features (phenotype) is often useful. Thus, porphyrias are usually divided into 2 classes:\\n• Acute\\n• Cutaneous\\nAcute porphyrias manifest as intermittent attacks of abdominal, mental, and neurologic symptoms. They\\nare typically triggered by drugs and other exogenous factors. Cutaneous porphyrias tend to cause\\ncontinuous or undulating symptoms involving cutaneous photosensitivity. Some acute porphyrias also\\nhave cutaneous manifestations. Because of variable penetrance in heterozygous porphyrias, clinically\\nexpressed disease is less common than genetic prevalence (see\\nTable 96-2\\n).\\nUrine discoloration (red or reddish brown) may occur in the symptomatic phase of all porphyrias except\\nerythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and ALAD-deficiency porphyria.

Fluid and Electrolyte Metabolism\\nIntroduction\\nBody fluid volume and electrolyte concentration are normally maintained within very narrow limits despite\\nwide variations in dietary intake, metabolic activity, and environmental stresses. Homeostasis of body\\nfluids is preserved primarily by the kidneys.\\nWater and Sodium Balance\\nWater and Na balance are closely interdependent. Total body water (TBW) is about 60% of body weight\\n(ranging from about 50% in obese people to 70% in lean people). Almost two thirds of TBW is in the\\nintracellular compartment (intracellular fluid, or ICF); the other one third is extracellular (extracellular fluid,\\nor ECF). Normally, about 25% of the ECF is in the intravascular compartment; the other 75% is interstitial\\nfluid (see\\nFig. 97-1\\n).\\nThe major intracellular cation is K, with an average concentration of 140 mEq/L. The extracellular K\\nconcentration is 3.5 to 5 mEq/L. The major extracellular cation is Na, with an average concentration of\\n140 mEq/L and an intracellular Na concentration of 12 mEq/L.\\nOsmotic forces:\\n The concentration of combined solutes in water is osmolarity (amount of solute per L of\\nsolution), which, in body fluids, is similar to osmolality (amount of solute per kg of solution). Plasma\\nosmolality can be measured in the laboratory or estimated according to the formula\\nPlasma osmolality (mOsm/kg) =\\nwhere serum Na is expressed in mEq/L and glucose and BUN are expressed in mg/dL. Osmolality of\\nbody fluids is normally between 275 and 290 mOsm/kg. Na is the major determinant of serum osmolality.\\nApparent changes in osmolality may result from errors in the measurement of Na with electrodes that are\\nnot ion selective (see under Diagnosis on p. \\n826\\n). An osmolar gap is present when measured osmolality\\nexceeds estimated osmolality by ≥ 10 mOsm/kg. It is caused by unmeasured osmotically active\\nsubstances present in the plasma. The most common are alcohols (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol,\\nethylene glycol), mannitol, and glycine.\\nWater crosses cell membranes freely from areas of low solute concentration to areas of high solute\\nconcentration. Thus, osmolality tends to equalize across the various body fluid compartments, resulting\\nprimarily from movement of water, not solutes. Solutes such as urea that freely diffuse across cell\\nmembranes have little or no effect on water shifts (little or no osmotic activity), whereas solutes that are\\nrestricted primarily to one fluid compartment, such as Na and K, have the greatest osmotic activity.\\nTonicity, or effective osmolality, reflects osmotic activity and determines the force drawing water across\\nfluid compartments (the osmotic force). Osmotic force can be opposed by other forces. For example,\\nplasma proteins have a small osmotic effect that tends to draw water into the plasma; this osmotic effect\\nis normally counteracted by vascular hydrostatic forces that drive water out of the plasma.\\nWater intake and excretion:\\n The average daily fluid intake is about 2.5 L. The amount needed to\\nreplace losses from the urine and other sources is about 1 to 1.5 L/day in healthy adults. However, on a\\nshort-term basis, an average\\n[\\nFig. 97-1.\\n Fluid compartments in an average 70-kg man.]\\nyoung adult with normal kidney function may ingest as little as 200 mL of water each day to excrete the\\nnitrogenous and other wastes generated by cellular metabolism.

With fever, another 50 to 75 mL/day may be\\nlost for each degree C of temperature elevation above normal. GI losses are usually negligible, except\\nwhen marked vomiting, diarrhea, or both occur. Sweat losses can be significant during environmental\\nheat exposure or excessive exercise.\\nWater intake is regulated by thirst. Thirst is triggered by receptors in the anterolateral hypothalamus that\\nrespond to increased serum osmolality (as little as 2%) or decreased body fluid volume. Rarely\\nhypothalamic dysfunction decreases the capacity for thirst.\\nWater excretion by the kidneys is regulated primarily by ADH (vasopressin). ADH is released by the\\nposterior pituitary and results in increased water reabsorption in the distal nephron. ADH release is\\nstimulated by any of the following:\\n• Increased serum osmolality\\n• Decreased blood volume\\n• Decreased BP\\n• Stress\\nADH release may be impaired by certain substances (eg, ethanol, phenytoin) and central diabetes\\ninsipidus (see p. \\n772\\n).\\nWater intake decreases serum osmolality. Low serum osmolality inhibits ADH secretion, allowing the\\nkidneys to produce dilute urine. The diluting capacity of healthy kidneys in young adults is such that\\nmaximum daily fluid intake can be as much as 25 L; greater amounts quickly lower serum osmolality.\\nDisorders of Fluid Volume\\nBecause Na is the major osmotically active ion in the ECF, total body Na content determines ECF volume.\\nDeficiency or excess of total body Na content causes ECF volume depletion or overload. Plasma Na\\nconcentration does not necessarily reflect total body Na.\\nDietary intake and renal excretion regulate total body Na content. When total Na content and ECF volume\\nare low, the kidneys increase Na conservation. When total Na content and ECF volume are high, Na\\nexcretion (natriuresis) increases so that volume decreases.\\nRenal Na excretion can be adjusted widely to match Na intake. Renal Na excretion requires delivery of\\nNa to the kidneys and so depends on renal blood flow and GFR. Thus, inadequate Na excretion may be\\nsecondary to decreased renal blood flow, as in chronic kidney disease or heart failure.\\nRenin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis:\\n The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is the main regulatory\\nmechanism of renal Na excretion. In volume-depleted states, GFR and Na delivery to the distal nephrons\\ndecreases, causing release of renin. Renin cleaves angiotensinogen (renin substrate) to form angiotensin\\nI. ACE then cleaves angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

Aldosterone release is also stimulated by hyperkalemia.\\nOther natriuretic factors:\\n Several other natriuretic factors have been identified, including atrial\\nnatriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP).\\nANP\\n is secreted by cardiac atrial tissue. Concentration increases in response to ECF volume overload\\n(eg, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis with ascites) and primary aldosteronism and in some\\npatients with primary hypertension.

BNP\\nassays are readily available. High BNP concentration is used to diagnose volume overload.\\nCNP\\n, in contrast to ANP and BNP, is primarily vasodilatory.\\nNa depletion and excess:\\n Na depletion requires inadequate Na intake plus abnormal losses from the\\nskin, GI tract, or kidneys (defective renal Na conservation). Defective renal Na conservation may be\\ncaused by primary renal disease, adrenal insufficiency, or diuretic therapy.\\nNa overload requires higher Na intake than excretion; however, because normal kidneys can excrete\\nlarge amounts of Na, Na overload generally reflects defective regulation of renal blood flow and Na\\nexcretion (eg, as occurs in heart failure, cirrhosis, or chronic kidney disease).\\nVolume Depletion\\nVolume depletion, or ECF volume contraction, occurs as a result of loss of total body Na.\\nCauses include vomiting, excessive sweating, diarrhea, burns, diuretic use, and kidney failure.\\nClinical features include diminished skin turgor, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia, and\\northostatic hypotension. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment involves administration of Na and\\nwater\\n.\\nBecause water crosses plasma membranes in the body through passive osmosis, loss of the major\\nextracellular cation (Na) quickly results in water loss from the ECF space as well. In this way, Na loss\\nalways causes water loss. However, depending on many factors, serum Na concentration can be high,\\nlow, or normal in volume-depleted patients (despite the decreased total body Na content). ECF volume is\\nrelated to effective circulating volume. A decrease in ECF (hypovolemia) generally causes a decrease in\\neffective circulating volume, which in turn causes decreased organ perfusion and leads to clinical\\nsequelae. Common causes of volume depletion are listed in\\nTable 97-1\\n.\\nSymptoms and Signs\\nIn mild volume depletion (< 5% of ECF), the only sign may be diminished skin turgor (best assessed at\\nthe upper torso).

ECF volume expansion\\ntypically occurs in heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and cirrhosis. Renal Na retention leads to\\nincreased total body Na content. This increase results in varying degrees of volume overload.\\nIn heart failure, the increased ECF volume results in decreased effective circulating volume,\\nwhich in turn causes decreased organ perfusion leading to clinical sequelae. Serum Na\\nconcentration can be high, low, or normal in volume-overloaded patients (despite the increased\\ntotal body Na content)\\n.\\nAn increase in total body Na is the key pathophysiologic event. It increases osmolality, which triggers\\ncompensatory mechanisms that cause water retention. When sufficient fluid accumulates in the ECF\\n(usually > 2.5 L), edema (see p. \\n2031\\n) develops.\\nAmong the most common causes of ECF volume overload are the following:\\n• Heart failure\\n• Cirrhosis\\n• Renal failure\\n• Nephrotic syndrome\\n• Premenstrual edema\\n• Pregnancy\\nClinical features include weight gain and edema. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment aims to correct the\\ncause.\\nHyponatremia\\nHyponatremia is decrease in serum Na concentration < 136 mEq/L caused by an excess of\\nwater relative to solute. Common causes include diuretic use, diarrhea, heart failure, and renal\\ndisease. Clinical manifestations are primarily neurologic (due to an osmotic shift of water into\\nbrain cells causing edema), especially in acute hyponatremia, and include headache, confusion,\\nand stupor; seizures and coma may occur. \\nDiagnosis is by measuring serum Na. Serum and\\nurine electrolytes and osmolality help determine the cause. Treatment involves restricting\\nwater intake and promoting its loss, replacing any Na deficit, and treating the cause.\\nEtiology\\nHyponatremia reflects an excess of total body water (TBW) relative to total body Na content. Because\\ntotal body Na content is reflected by ECF volume status, hyponatremia must be considered along with\\nstatus of the ECF volume: hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia (see\\nTable 97-2\\n). Note that the ECF volume is not the same as effective plasma volume.

Significant ECF fluid losses also cause release of ADH, causing\\nwater retention by the kidneys, which can maintain or worsen hyponatremia. In extrarenal causes of\\nhypovolemia, because the normal renal response to volume loss is Na conservation, urine Na\\nconcentration is typically < 10 mEq/L.\\nRenal fluid losses\\n resulting in hypovolemic hyponatremia may occur with mineralocorticoid deficiency,\\ndiuretic therapy, osmotic diuresis, or salt-losing nephropathy. Salt-losing nephropathy encompasses a\\nloosely defined group of intrinsic renal disorders with primarily renal tubular dysfunction. This group\\nincludes interstitial nephritis, medullary cystic disease, partial urinary tract obstruction, and, occasionally,\\npolycystic kidney disease. Renal causes of hypovolemic hyponatremia can usually be differentiated from\\nextrarenal causes by the history. Patients with ongoing renal fluid losses can also be distinguished from\\npatients with extrarenal fluid losses because the urine Na concentration is inappropriately high (> 20\\nmEq/L). Urine Na concentration may not help in differentiation when metabolic alkalosis (as occurs with\\nprotracted vomiting) is present and large amounts of HCO\\n3\\n are spilled in the urine, obligating the\\nexcretion of Na to maintain electrical neutrality. In metabolic alkalosis, urine Cl concentration frequently\\ndifferentiates renal from extrarenal sources of volume depletion (see p. \\n862\\n).\\n[\\nTable 97-3.\\n Composition of Body Fluids]\\n[\\nTable 97-4.\\n Approximate Na Content of Common Beverages]\\nDiuretics\\n may also cause hypovolemic hyponatremia. Thiazide diuretics, in particular, decrease the\\nkidneys' diluting capacity and increase Na excretion. Once volume depletion occurs, the nonosmotic\\nrelease of ADH causes water retention and worsens hyponatremia. Concomitant hypokalemia shifts Na\\nintracellularly and enhances ADH release, thereby worsening hyponatremia. This effect of thiazides may\\nlast for up to 2 wk after cessation of therapy; however, hyponatremia usually responds to replacement of\\nK and volume deficits along with judicious monitoring of water intake until the drug effect dissipates.\\nElderly patients may have increased Na diuresis and are especially susceptible to thiazide-induced\\nhyponatremia, particularly when they have a preexisting defect in renal capacity to excrete free water.\\nRarely, such patients develop severe, life-threatening hyponatremia within a few weeks after the initiation\\nof a thiazide diuretic. Loop diuretics much less commonly cause hyponatremia.\\nEuvolemic hyponatremia:\\n In euvolemic (dilutional) hyponatremia, total body Na and thus ECF volume\\nare normal or near-normal; however, TBW is increased.\\nPrimary polydipsia can cause hyponatremia only when water intake overwhelms the kidneys' ability to\\nexcrete water. Because normal kidneys can excrete up to 25 L urine/day, hyponatremia due solely to\\npolydipsia results only from the ingestion of large amounts of water or from defects in renal capacity to\\nexcrete free water. Patients affected include those with psychosis or more modest degrees of polydipsia\\nplus renal insufficiency.\\nEuvolemic hyponatremia may also result from excessive water intake in the presence \\nof Addison's\\ndisease, hypothyroidism, or nonosmotic ADH release (eg, due to stress; postoperative states; use of\\ndrugs such as chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, opioids, barbiturates, vincristine, clofibrate, or\\ncarbamazepine). Postoperative hyponatremia most commonly occurs because of a combination of\\nnonosmotic ADH release and excessive administration of hypotonic fluids after surgery.

Because total\\nbody Na content is reflected by ECF volume status, hypernatremia must be considered along with status\\nof the ECF volume: hypovolemia, euvolemia, and hypervolemia.

For example, decreased effective plasma volume may occur with\\ndecreased ECF volume, but it may also occur with an increased ECF volume (eg, in heart failure,\\nhypoalbuminemia, or capillary leak syndrome).\\nHypernatremia usually implies either an impaired thirst mechanism or limited access to water. The\\nseverity of the underlying disorder that results in an inability to drink in response to thirst and the effects\\nof brain hyperosmolality are thought to be responsible for a high mortality rate in hospitalized adults with\\nhypernatremia. There are several common causes of hypernatremia (see\\nTable 97-6\\n).\\nHypovolemic hypernatremia:\\n Hypernatremia associated with hypovolemia occurs with Na loss\\naccompanied by a relatively greater loss of water from the body.

Loop diuretics inhibit\\nNa reabsorption in the concentrating portion of the nephrons and can increase water clearance. Osmotic\\ndiuresis can also impair renal concentrating capacity because of a hypertonic substance present in the\\ntubular lumen of the distal nephron.

The most common cause of hypernatremia due to osmotic diuresis is\\nhyperglycemia in patients with diabetes.

Patients with renal disease\\ncan also be predisposed to hypernatremia when their kidneys are unable to maximally concentrate urine.\\nEuvolemic hypernatremia:\\n Hypernatremia with euvolemia is a decrease in TBW with nearnormal total\\nbody Na (pure water deficit). Extrarenal causes of water loss, such as excessive sweating, result in some\\nNa loss, but because sweat is hypotonic, hypernatremia can result before significant hypovolemia. A\\ndeficit of almost purely water also occurs in central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\\nEssential hypernatremia (primary hypodipsia) occasionally occurs in children with brain damage and in\\nchronically ill elderly adults. It is characterized by an impaired thirst mechanism (eg, caused by lesions of\\nthe brain's thirst center). Altered osmotic trigger for ADH release is another possible cause of euvolemic\\nhypernatremia; some lesions cause both an impaired thirst mechanism and an altered osmotic trigger.\\nThe nonosmotic release of ADH seems intact, and these patients are generally euvolemic.\\nHypervolemic hypernatremia:\\n Hypernatremia in rare cases is associated with volume overload. In this\\ncase, hypernatremia results from a grossly elevated Na intake associated with limited access to water.\\nOne example is the excessive administration of hypertonic NaHCO\\n3\\n during treatment of lactic acidosis.\\nHypernatremia can also be caused by the administration of hypertonic saline or incorrectly formulated\\nhyperalimentation.\\nHypernatremia in the elderly:\\n Hypernatremia is common among the elderly, particularly postoperative\\npatients and those receiving tube feedings or parenteral nutrition.

The absence of thirst in conscious patients with\\nhypernatremia suggests an impaired thirst mechanism. Patients with difficulty communicating may be\\nunable to express thirst or obtain access to water.\\nThe major signs of hypernatremia result from CNS dysfunction due to brain cell shrinkage. Confusion,\\nneuromuscular excitability, hyperreflexia, seizures, or coma may result; cerebrovascular damage with\\nsubcortical or subarachnoid hemorrhage and venous thromboses are common among patients who died\\nfrom severe hypernatremia.\\nIn chronic hypernatremia, osmotically active substances occur in CNS cells (idiogenic osmoles) and\\nincrease intracellular osmolality.

In patients who do not respond to simple\\nrehydration or in whom hypernatremia recurs despite adequate access to water, further diagnostic testing\\nis warranted. Determination of the underlying disorder requires assessment of urine volume and\\nosmolality, particularly after water deprivation.\\nIn patients with increased urine output, a water deprivation test (see p. \\n773\\n) is occasionally used to\\ndifferentiate among several polyuric states, such as central and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\\nTreatment\\n• Replacement of intravascular volume and of free water\\nReplacement of intravascular volume and of free water is the main goal of treatment. Oral hydration is\\neffective in conscious patients without significant GI dysfunction. In severe hypernatremia or in patients\\nunable to drink because of continued vomiting or mental status changes, IV hydration is preferred.\\nHypernatremia that lasts < 24 h should be corrected within 24 h. However, hypernatremia that is chronic\\nor of unknown duration should be corrected over 48 h, and the serum osmolality should be lowered at a\\nrate of no faster than 2 mOsm/L/h to avoid cerebral edema caused by excess brain solute. The amount of\\nwater (in liters) necessary to replace existing deficits may be estimated by the following formula:\\nFree water deficit = TBW × [serum Na/140) - 1]\\nwhere TBW is in liters and is estimated by multiplying weight in kilograms by 0.6; serum Na is in mEq/L.\\nThis formula assumes constant total body Na content. In patients with hypernatremia and depletion of\\ntotal body Na content (ie, who have volume depletion), the free water deficit is greater than that estimated\\nby the formula.\\nIn patients with hypernatremia and ECF volume overload (excess total body Na content), the free water\\ndeficit can be replaced with 5% D/W, which can be supplemented with a loop diuretic. However, too-rapid\\ninfusion of 5% D/W may cause glycosuria, thereby increasing salt-free water excretion and hypertonicity,\\nespecially in patients with diabetes mellitus.

The ratio between ICF and ECF K concentrations\\nstrongly influences cell membrane polarization, which in turn influences important cell processes, such as\\nthe conduction of nerve impulses and muscle (including myocardial) cell contraction. Thus, relatively\\nsmall alterations in serum K concentration can have significant clinical manifestations.\\nIn the absence of factors that shift K in or out of cells (see p. \\n832\\n), the serum K concentration correlates\\nclosely with total body K content. Once intracellular and extracellular concentrations are stable, a\\ndecrease in serum K concentration of about 1 mEq/L indicates a total K deficit of about 200 to 400 mEq.\\nPatients with K < 3 mEq/L typically have a significant K deficit.\\nK shifts:\\n Factors that shift K in or out of cells include the following:\\n• Insulin concentrations\\n• \\nβ\\n-Adrenergic activity\\n• Acid-base status\\nInsulin moves K into cells; high concentrations of insulin thus lower serum K concentration. Low insulin\\nconcentrations, as in diabetic ketoacidosis, cause K to move out of cells, thus raising serum K, sometimes\\neven in the presence of total body K deficiency.\\nβ\\n-Adrenergic agonists, especially selective \\nβ\\n2\\n-agonists, move K into cells, whereas \\nβ\\n-blockade and \\nα\\n-\\nagonists promote movement of K out of cells.\\nAcute metabolic acidosis causes K to move out of cells, whereas acute metabolic alkalosis causes K to\\nmove into cells. However, changes in serum HCO\\n3\\n concentration may be more important than changes in\\npH; acidosis caused by accumulation of mineral acids (nonanion gap, hyperchloremic acidosis) is more\\nlikely to elevate serum K. In contrast, metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of organic acids (increased\\nanion gap acidosis) is not associated with hyperkalemia. Thus, the hyperkalemia common in diabetic\\nketoacidosis results more from insulin deficiency than from acidosis. Acute respiratory acidosis and\\nalkalosis affect serum K concentration less than metabolic acidosis and alkalosis. Nonetheless, serum K\\nconcentration should always be interpreted in the context of the serum pH (and HCO\\n3\\n concentration).\\nK metabolism:\\n Dietary K intake normally varies between 40 and 150 mEq/day. In the steady state, fecal\\nlosses are usually close to 10% of intake. Urinary excretion contributes to K balance.\\nWhen K intake is > 150 mEq/day, about 50% of the excess K appears in the urine over the next several\\nhours. Most of the remainder is transferred into the intracellular compartment, thus minimizing the rise in\\nserum K. When elevated K intake continues, aldosterone secretion is stimulated and thus renal K\\nexcretion rises. In addition, K absorption from stool appears to be under some regulation and may fall by\\n50% in chronic K excess.\\nWhen K intake falls, intracellular K again serves to buffer wide swings in serum K concentration. Renal K\\nconservation develops relatively slowly in response to decreases in dietary K and is far less efficient than\\nthe kidneys' ability to conserve Na. Thus, K depletion is a frequent clinical problem. Urinary K excretion of\\n10 mEq/day represents near-maximal renal K conservation and implies significant K depletion.\\nAcute acidosis impairs K excretion, whereas chronic acidosis and acute alkalosis can promote K\\nexcretion. Increased delivery of Na to the distal nephrons, as occurs with high Na intake or loop diuretic\\ntherapy, promotes K excretion.\\nFalse K concentrations:\\n Pseudohypokalemia, or falsely low serum K, occasionally occurs in patients\\nwith chronic myelocytic leukemia with a WBC count > 10\\n5\\n/\\nμ\\nL when the specimen remains at room\\ntemperature before being processed because of uptake of serum K by abnormal leukocytes in the\\nsample.

Cytosolic ionized Ca is maintained within\\nthe micromolar range (< 1/1000 of the serum concentration). Ionized Ca acts as an intracellular 2nd\\nmessenger; it is involved in skeletal muscle contraction, excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and\\nsmooth muscle, and activation of protein kinases and enzyme phosphorylation. Ca is also involved in the\\naction of other intracellular messengers, such as cAMP and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, and thus\\nmediates the cellular response to \\nnumerous hormones, including epinephrine, glucagon, ADH\\n(vasopressin), secretin, and cholecystokinin. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) increases urinary cAMP.\\nDespite its important intracellular roles, about 99% of body Ca is in bone, mainly as hydroxyapatite\\ncrystals. About 1% of bone Ca is freely exchangeable with the ECF and, therefore, is available for\\nbuffering changes in Ca balance.\\nNormal total serum Ca concentration ranges from 8.8 to 10.4 mg/dL (2.20 to 2.60 mmol/L). About 40% of\\nthe total blood Ca is bound to plasma proteins, primarily albumin. The remaining 60% includes ionized Ca\\nplus Ca complexed with phosphate (PO\\n4\\n) and citrate. Total Ca (ie, protein-bound, complexed, and ionized\\nCa) is usually what is determined by clinical laboratory measurement. Ideally, ionized or free Ca should be\\ndetermined because it is the physiologically active form of Ca in plasma; this determination, because of\\nits technical difficulty, is usually restricted to patients in whom significant alteration of protein binding of\\nserum Ca is suspected. Ionized Ca is generally assumed to be about 50% of the total serum Ca.\\nRegulation of Calcium Metabolism\\nThe metabolism of Ca and of PO\\n4\\n (see p. \\n850\\n) is intimately related. The regulation of both Ca and PO\\n4\\nbalance is greatly influenced by concentrations of circulating PTH, vitamin D, and, to a lesser extent,\\ncalcitonin. Ca and inorganic PO\\n4\\n concentrations are also linked by their ability to chemically react to form\\nCaPO\\n4\\n. The product of concentrations of Ca and PO\\n4\\n (in mEq/L) is estimated to be 60 normally; when\\nthe product exceeds 70, precipitation of CaPO\\n4\\n crystals in soft tissue is much more likely. Calcification of\\nvascular tissue accelerates arteriosclerotic vascular disease and may occur when the Ca × PO\\n4\\n product\\nis even lower (> 55), especially in patients with chronic kidney disease.\\nPTH is secreted by the parathyroid glands. It has several actions, but perhaps the most important is to\\ndefend against hypocalcemia. Parathyroid cells sense decreases in serum Ca and, in response, release\\npreformed PTH into the circulation. PTH increases serum Ca within minutes by increasing renal and\\nintestinal absorption of Ca and by rapidly mobilizing Ca and PO\\n4\\n from bone (bone resorption). Renal Ca\\nexcretion generally parallels Na excretion and is influenced by many of the same factors that govern Na\\ntransport in the proximal tubule. However, PTH enhances distal tubular Ca reabsorption independently of\\nNa. PTH also decreases renal PO\\n4\\n reabsorption and thus increases renal PO\\n4\\n losses. Renal PO\\n4\\n loss\\nprevents the solubility product of Ca and PO\\n4\\n from being exceeded in plasma as Ca concentrations rise\\nin response to PTH. PTH also increases serum Ca by stimulating conversion of vitamin D (see p. \\n41\\n) to\\nits most active form, calcitriol. This form of vitamin D increases the percentage of dietary Ca absorbed by\\nthe intestine. Despite increased Ca absorption, long-term increases in PTH secretion generally result in\\nfurther bone resorption by inhibiting osteoblastic function and promoting osteoclastic activity. PTH and\\nvitamin D both function as important regulators of bone growth and bone remodeling (see p. \\n41\\n).\\nRadioimmunoassays for the intact PTH molecule are still the recommended way to test for PTH. Second-\\ngeneration assays for intact PTH are available. These tests measure bioavailable PTH or complete PTH.\\nThey give values equal to 50 to 60% of those obtained with the older assay. Usefulness of the newer\\nassays is under investigation. Sometimes total or nephrogenous cAMP excretion is measured in diagnosis\\nof pseudohypoparathyroidism.\\nCalcitonin is secreted by the thyroid parafollicular cells (C cells). Calcitonin tends to lower serum Ca\\nconcentration by enhancing cellular uptake, renal excretion, and bone formation.

Risk factors for\\nsevere hypocalcemia after subtotal parathyroidectomy include\\n• Severe preoperative hypercalcemia\\n• Removal of a large adenoma\\n• Elevated alkaline phosphatase\\n• Chronic kidney disease\\nIdiopathic hypoparathyroidism is an uncommon sporadic or inherited condition in which the parathyroid\\nglands are absent or atrophied.

An\\nintracellular resistance to cAMP has been proposed.\\nVitamin D deficiency and dependency:\\n Vitamin D deficiency and dependency are discussed in full\\nelsewhere (see p. \\n41\\n). Vitamin D is ingested in foods naturally high in vitamin D or fortified with it. It is also\\nformed in the skin in response to sunlight. Vitamin D deficiency may result from inadequate dietary intake\\nor decreased absorption due to hepatobiliary disease or intestinal malabsorption. It can also result from\\nalterations in vitamin D metabolism as occur with certain drugs (eg, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin) or\\ndecreased formation in the skin due to lack of exposure to sunlight. Aging also decreases skin synthetic\\ncapacity. Decreased skin synthesis is an important cause of acquired vitamin D deficiency among people\\nwho spend a great deal of time indoors, who live in high northern or southern latitudes, and who wear\\nclothing that covers them completely. Accordingly, subclinical vitamin D deficiency is fairly common,\\nespecially during winter months in temperate climates among the elderly. The institutionalized elderly are\\nat particular risk because of decreased skin synthetic capacity, undernutrition, and lack of sun exposure.\\nIn fact, most people with deficiency have both decreased skin synthesis and dietary deficiency (see also\\np. \\n41\\n).\\nType I vitamin D-dependent rickets (pseudovitamin D-deficiency rickets) is an autosomal recessive\\ndisorder involving a mutation in the gene encoding the 1-\\nα\\n-hydroxylase enzyme. Normally expressed in\\nthe kidney, 1-\\nα\\n-hydroxylase is needed to convert inactive vitamin D to the active form calcitriol.\\nIn type II vitamin D-dependent rickets, target organs cannot respond to calcitriol.

Muscle weakness, pain, and typical bone\\ndeformities can occur.\\nRenal disease:\\n Renal tubular disease, including acquired proximal renal tubular acidosis due to\\nnephrotoxins (eg, heavy metals) and distal renal tubular acidosis, can cause severe hypocalcemia due to\\nabnormal renal loss of Ca and decreased renal conversion to 1,25(OH)\\n2\\nD.

There are many causes of hypercalcemia\\n(see\\nTable 97-9\\n), but the most common are hyperparathyroidism and cancer.\\nPathophysiology\\nPrimary hyperparathyroidism\\n is a generalized disorder resulting from excessive secretion of\\nparathyroid hormone (PTH) by one or more parathyroid glands. It probably is the most common cause of\\nhypercalcemia, particularly among patients who are not hospitalized. Incidence increases with age and is\\nhigher in postmenopausal women. It also occurs in high frequency ≥ 3 decades after neck irradiation.\\nFamilial and sporadic forms exist. Familial forms due to parathyroid adenoma occur in patients with other\\nendocrine tumors (see p. \\n909\\n). Primary hyperparathyroidism causes hypophosphatemia and excessive\\nbone resorption. Although asymptomatic hypercalcemia is the most frequent presentation, nephrolithiasis\\nis also common, particularly when hypercalciuria occurs due to long-standing hypercalcemia. Histologic\\nexamination shows a parathyroid adenoma in about 85% of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism,\\nalthough it is sometimes difficult to distinguish an adenoma from a normal gland. About 15% of cases are\\ndue to hyperplasia of ≥ 2 glands. Parathyroid cancer occurs in < 1% of cases.\\nThe syndrome of \\nfamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)\\n is transmitted as an autosomal dominant\\ntrait. Most cases involve an inactivating mutation of the Ca-sensing receptor gene, resulting in higher\\nconcentrations of serum Ca being needed to inhibit PTH secretion. Subsequent PTH secretion induces\\nrenal phosphate (PO\\n4\\n) excretion. Persistent hypercalcemia (usually asymptomatic), often from an early\\nage; normal to slightly elevated concentrations of PTH; hypocalciuria; and hypermagnesemia occur.\\nRenal function is normal, and nephrolithiasis is unusual. However, severe pancreatitis occasionally\\noccurs. This syndrome, which is associated with parathyroid hyperplasia, is not relieved by subtotal\\nparathyroidectomy.\\nSecondary hyperparathyroidism\\n occurs most commonly in advanced chronic kidney\\n[\\nTable 97-9.\\n Principal Causes of Hypercalcemia]\\ndisease when decreased formation of active vitamin D in the kidneys and other factors lead to\\nhypocalcemia and chronic stimulation of PTH secretion. Hyperphosphatemia that develops in response to\\nchronic kidney disease also contributes. Once established, hypercalcemia or normocalcemia may occur.\\nThe sensitivity of the parathyroid to Ca may be diminished because of pronounced glandular hyperplasia\\nand elevation of the Ca set point (ie, the amount of Ca necessary to reduce secretion of PTH).\\nTertiary hyperparathyroidism\\n results in autonomous hypersecretion of PTH regardless of serum Ca\\nconcentration. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism generally occurs in patients with long-standing secondary\\nhyperparathyroidism, as in patients with end-stage renal disease of several years' duration.\\nCancer\\n is a common cause of hypercalcemia, usually in hospitalized patients. Although there are several\\nmechanisms, elevated serum Ca ultimately occurs as a result of bone resorption. Humoral hypercalcemia\\nof cancer (ie, hypercalcemia with no or minimal bone metastases) occurs most commonly with squamous\\ncell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer. Many cases of\\nhumoral hypercalcemia of cancer were formerly attributed to ectopic production of PTH. However, some\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 97.

Although serum\\nconcentrations are low in most patients with solid tumors, patients with lymphoma and T-cell leukemia\\nsometimes have elevated concentrations due to dysregulation of the 1-\\nα\\n-hydroxylase enzyme present in\\ntumor cells.

In sarcoidosis, hypercalcemia and\\nhypercalciuria seem to be due to unregulated conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)\\n2\\nD, presumably due to\\nexpression of the 1-\\nα\\n-hydroxylase enzyme in mononuclear cells within sarcoid granulomas.

The dose can be increased to 500 mg qid prn\\nunless diarrhea develops. Another treatment is increasing urinary Ca excretion by giving isotonic saline\\nplus a loop diuretic.

Most phosphorus in the body is\\ncomplexed with O\\n2\\n as phosphate (PO\\n4\\n). About 85% of the about 500 to 700 g of PO\\n4\\n in the body is\\ncontained in bone, where it is an important constituent of crystalline hydroxyapatite. In soft tissues, PO\\n4\\n is\\nmainly found in the intracellular compartment as an integral component of several organic compounds,\\nincluding nucleic acids and cell membrane phospholipids. PO\\n4\\n is also involved in aerobic and anaerobic\\nenergy metabolism. RBC 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) plays a crucial role in O\\n2\\n delivery to tissue.\\nAdenosine diphosphate (ADP) and ATP contain PO\\n4\\n and use chemical bonds between PO\\n4\\n groups to\\nstore energy. Inorganic PO\\n4\\n is a major intracellular anion but is also present in plasma. The normal serum\\ninorganic PO\\n4\\n concentration in adults ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL (0.81 to 1.45 mmol/L). PO\\n4\\nconcentration is 50% higher in infants and 30% higher in children, possibly because of the important roles\\nthese PO\\n4\\n-dependent processes play in growth.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 97.

Acid-Base Regulation and Disorders\\nIntroduction\\nMetabolic processes continually produce acid and, to a lesser degree, base. Hydrogen ion (H\\n+\\n) is\\nespecially reactive; it can attach to negatively charged proteins and, in high concentrations, alter their\\noverall charge, configuration, and function. To maintain cellular function, the body has elaborate\\nmechanisms that maintain blood H\\n+\\n concentration within a narrow range—typically 37 to 43 nmol/L (pH\\n7.43 to 7.37, where pH = -log [H\\n+\\n]) and ideally 40 nmol/L (pH = 7.40). Disturbances of these mechanisms\\ncan have serious clinical consequences.\\nAcid-base equilibrium is closely tied to fluid and electrolyte balance, and disturbances in one of these\\nsystems often affect another. Fluid and electrolytes are discussed in \\nCh. 97\\n.\\nAcid-Base Physiology\\nMost acid comes from carbohydrate and fat metabolism, which generates 15,000 to 20,000 mmol of CO\\n2\\ndaily. CO\\n2\\n is not an acid itself but combines with water (H\\n2\\nO) in the blood to create carbonic acid\\n(H\\n2\\nCO\\n3\\n), which in the presence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase dissociates into H\\n+\\n and HCO\\n3\\n-\\n. The\\nH\\n+\\n binds with Hb in RBCs and is released with oxygenation in the alveoli, at which time the reaction is\\nreversed, creating H\\n2\\nO and CO\\n2\\n, which is exhaled in each breath.\\nLesser amounts of organic acid derive from the following:\\n• Incomplete metabolism of glucose and fatty acids into lactic acid and ketoacids\\n• Metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine, methionine) into sulfuric acid\\n• \\nMetabolism of cationic amino acids (arginine, lysine)\\n• Hydrolysis of dietary phosphate\\nThis \"fixed\" or \"metabolic\" acid load cannot be exhaled and therefore must be neutralized or excreted.\\nMost base comes from metabolism of anionic amino acids (glutamate and aspartate) and from oxidation\\nand consumption of organic anions such as lactate and citrate, which produce HCO\\n3\\n-\\n.\\nAcid-Base Balance\\nAcid-base balance is maintained by chemical buffering and by pulmonary and renal elimination.\\nChemical buffering:\\n Chemical buffers are solutions that resist changes in pH. Intracellular and\\nextracellular buffers provide an immediate response to acid-base disturbances. Bone also plays an\\nimportant buffering role. A buffer is made up of a weak acid and its conjugate base. The conjugate base\\ncan accept H\\n+\\n and the weak acid can relinquish it thereby minimizing changes in free H\\n+\\n concentration.\\nThe most important extracellular buffer is the HCO\\n3\\n-\\n/CO\\n2\\n system, described by the equation:\\nH\\n+\\n + HCO\\n3\\n-\\n \\n⇔\\n H\\n2\\nCO\\n3\\n \\n⇔\\n CO\\n2\\n + H\\n2\\nO\\nAn increase in H\\n+\\n drives the equation to the right and generates CO\\n2\\n. This important buffer system is\\nhighly regulated; CO\\n2\\n concentrations can be finely controlled by alveolar ventilation, and H\\n+\\n and HCO\\n3\\n-\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 98.

With this formula, any 2 values (usually H\\n+\\n and PCO\\n2\\n) can be used to\\ncalculate the other (usually HCO\\n3\\n-\\n).\\nOther important physiologic buffers include intracellular organic and inorganic phosphates and proteins,\\nincluding Hb in RBCs. Less important are extracellular phosphate and plasma proteins. Bone becomes an\\nimportant buffer after consumption of extracellular HCO\\n3\\n-\\n. Bone initially releases sodium carbonate\\n(NaHCO\\n3\\n) and potassium carbonate (KHCO\\n3\\n) in exchange for H\\n+\\n. With prolonged acid loads, bone\\nreleases calcium carbonate (CaCO\\n3\\n) and calcium phosphate (CaPO\\n4\\n). Long-standing acidemia therefore\\ncontributes to bone demineralization and osteoporosis.\\nPulmonary regulation:\\n CO\\n2\\n concentration is finely regulated by changes in tidal volume and respiratory\\nrate (minute ventilation). A decrease in pH is sensed by arterial chemoreceptors and leads to increases in\\ntidal volume or respiratory rate; CO\\n2\\n is exhaled and blood pH increases. In contrast to chemical buffering,\\nwhich is immediate, pulmonary regulation occurs over minutes to hours. It is about 50 to 75% effective; it\\ndoes not completely normalize pH.\\nRenal regulation:\\n The kidneys control pH by adjusting the amount of HCO\\n3\\n-\\n that is reabsorbed and the\\namount of H\\n+\\n that is excreted; increase in HCO\\n3\\n-\\n is equivalent to removing free H\\n+\\n. Changes in renal\\nacid-base handling occur hours to days after changes in acid-base status.\\nHCO\\n3\\n-\\n reabsorption occurs mostly in the proximal tubule and, to a lesser degree, in the collecting tubule.\\nH\\n2\\nO within the tubular cell dissociates into H\\n+\\n and hydroxide (OH\\n-\\n); in the presence of carbonic\\nanhydrase, the OH\\n-\\n combines with CO\\n2\\n to form HCO\\n3\\n-\\n, which is transported back into the peritubular\\ncapillary, while the H\\n+\\n is secreted into the tubular lumen and joins with freely filtered HCO\\n3\\n-\\n to form CO\\n2\\nand H\\n2\\nO, which are also reabsorbed. Thus, reabsorbed HCO\\n3\\n-\\n ions are newly generated and not the\\nsame as those that were filtered. Decreases in effective circulating volume (such as occur with diuretic\\ntherapy) increase HCO\\n3\\n-\\n reabsorption, while increases in parathyroid hormone in response to an acid\\nload decrease HCO\\n3\\n-\\n reabsorption. Also, increased PCO\\n2\\n leads to increased HCO\\n3\\n-\\n reabsorption, while\\nCl\\n-\\n depletion (typically from volume depletion) leads to increased Na\\n+\\n reabsorption and HCO\\n3\\n-\\ngeneration by the proximal tubule.\\nAcid is actively excreted into the proximal and distal tubules where it combines with urinary buffers\\n—primarily freely filtered HPO\\n4\\n-2\\n, creatinine, uric acid, and ammonia—to be transported outside the body.\\nThe ammonia buffering system is especially important because other buffers are filtered in fixed\\nconcentrations and can be depleted by high acid loads; by contrast, tubular cells actively regulate\\nammonia production in response to changes in acid load. Arterial pH is the main determinant of acid\\nsecretion, but excretion is also influenced by K\\n+\\n, Cl\\n-\\n, and aldosterone levels. Intracellular K\\n+\\nconcentration and H\\n+\\n secretion are reciprocally related; K\\n+\\n depletion causes increased H\\n+\\n secretion and\\nhence metabolic alkalosis.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 98.

The ABG directly measures arterial pH and PCO\\n2\\n. HCO\\n3\\n-\\nlevels on ABG are calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation; levels on serum chemistry\\npanels are directly measured and are more accurate. Acid-base balance is generally most accurately\\nassessed with measurement of pH and pCO\\n2\\n on arterial blood. In cases of circulatory failure or during\\ncardiopulmonary resuscitation, measurements on venous blood may more accurately reflect conditions at\\nthe tissue level and may be a more useful guide to bicarbonate administration and adequacy of\\nventilation.\\nThe pH establishes the primary process (acidosis or alkalosis), although it moves toward the normal\\nrange with compensation. Changes in PCO\\n2\\n reflect the respiratory component, and changes in HCO\\n3\\n-\\nreflect the metabolic component. However, several calculations may be required to determine whether\\nchanges in PCO\\n2\\n and HCO\\n3\\n-\\n are primary or compensatory and whether a mixed disorder is present; in\\nmixed \\ndisorders, values may be deceptively normal. Interpretation must also consider clinical conditions\\n(eg, chronic lung disease, renal failure, drug overdose).\\nSidebar 98-1 The Anion Gap\\nThe anion gap is defined as plasma Na concentration minus the sum of Cl\\n-\\n and HCO\\n3\\n-\\n concentrations;\\nNa\\n+\\n - (Cl\\n-\\n + HCO\\n3\\n-\\n). The term \"gap\" is misleading, because the law of electroneutrality requires the\\nsame number of positive and negative charges in an open system; the gap appears on laboratory testing\\nbecause certain cations (+) and anions (-) are not measured on routine laboratory chemistry panels. Thus\\nNa\\n+\\n + unmeasured cations (UC) = Cl\\n-\\n + HCO\\n3\\n-\\n + unmeasured anions (UA)\\nand\\nthe anion gap, Na\\n+\\n - (Cl\\n-\\n + HCO\\n3\\n-\\n) = UA - UC\\nThe predominant unmeasured anions are PO\\n4\\n3-\\n, sulfate (SO\\n4\\n-\\n), various negatively charged proteins,\\nand some organic acids, accounting for 20 to 24 mEq/L. The predominant unmeasured extracellular\\ncations are K\\n+\\n, Ca\\n++\\n, and Mg\\n++\\n and account for about 11 mEq/L. Thus the typical anion gap is 23 - 11 =\\n12 mEq/L. The anion gap can be affected by increases or decreases in the UC or UA.\\nThe Merck Manual of Diagnosis & Therapy, 19th Edition Chapter 98. Acid-Base Regulation & Disorders\\n990'),\n",
